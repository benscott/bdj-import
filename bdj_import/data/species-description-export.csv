<p><strong><em>Potamethus </em>sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>Sea Lion: station 40MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Large species; voucher is the only specimen encountered in this study; complete, with branchial crown; body 35 mm long, crown 17mm long, body 2mm wide; 8 thoracic and 39 abdominal chaetigers; chaetigers very crowded and very wide in posterior abdomen given the specimen somewhat swollen look towards the pygidium; colour in alcohol light tan to pink.</p>
<p>Branchial crown with 8 pairs of radioles, basally connected by a well-developed palmate membrane; radioles with pinnules to the tip; ventral filaments absent.</p>
<p>Collar most developed ventrally with distinctly elongate posterior peristomial ring, laterally and dorsally as a low lobes; dorsally forming two pockets, not overlapping at midline. Peristomial eyes not observed. Glandular ridge on chaetiger 2 present.</p>
<p>Collar uncini limbate notochaetae ranged in longitudinal rows. Thoracic superior notochaetae long, broadly limbate about 10 per fascicles and numerous, shorter mucronate chaetae arranged in 2 rows (around 9 chaetae per row). Thoracic uncini avicular with very long handles, breast as a pronounced swelling, about 14 per fascicle, arranged in single row, each with main fang and 4 small, diminishing in size teeth as seen in profile; with a row of smaller, hooked-shaped companion chaetae.</p>
<p>Abdominal neurochaetae composed of thin capillaries, around 6 per fascicle and row of 6 mucronate chaetae (narrower than thoracic mucronate chaetae); posterior neurochaetae change shape dramatically; in posterior abdominal segments neurochaetae as shorter and longer thickened (almost spine-like) narrowly limbate capillaries with very distinct long, thin mucrons. Abdominal uncini of anterior and mid abdominal chaetigers long handled, similar to thoracic unicni, around 20 per fascicle arranged in single row anterior and mid abdominal segments, reducing in numbers posteriorly.</p>
<p>Pygidium indistinct, very small triangular lobe; pygidial eyes not observed. Fragments of tube observed, composed of fine mud, greyish in colour, smooth without embedded particles.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>The FI specimen belong to genus <em>Potamethus</em> as they possess a girdle on chaetiger 2, and distinctly elongate posterior peristomial ring of the collar, although the form of thoracic uncini is distinctly avicular not acicular as otherwise common for species with girdle on chaetiger 2. <em>Potamethus scotiae</em> was described from Princess Martha Coast, around 2500m depth by Pixel (1913), however her original description was very brief (concentrating mostly on branchial crown and shape of collar, while at the same time providing drawings for chaetae only) and, therefore, of relatively little value. Nevertheless Pixell (1913) pictured and described only 1 type of abdominal neurochaetae, not 2 as clearly obvious in FI specimens. Knight-Jones (1983) re-examined holotypes and re-defined genus <em>Potamethus</em>. Based on drawings she provided for <em>P. scotiae</em>, the collar is not the same as for the one found in Falkland specimens. Knox and Cameron (1998) also provided description of <em>P. scotiae</em>, this time from the Ross Sea. The collar corresponds well with that of genus <em>Potamethus</em>, but they reported only one type of abdominal neurochaetae, as well as large number of radiolar pairs in comparison to FI specimens (15 versus 8).</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Large, robust species; body covered by sheath, giving the body a smooth appearance (chaetae not clearly protruding from the body); body cylindrical, gradually tapering posteriorly, without clear division between thorax and abdomen; body segments narrow (much wider than long) and crowded throughout. The largest voucher specimen complete with branchial crown; body 35mm long, branchial crown 15mm long, body width 4mm, body curved into crescent-like shape, colour in alcohol dark yellow; the smallest voucher complete with branchial crown; body 4mm long, branchial crown 3mm long, body width 1 mm; body straight. Thorax with 8 chaetigers, abdomen with 22 or more chaetigers (depending on size).</p>
<p>Large voucher with 13 pairs of radioles fused at the base by a palmate membrane, ventral pair shortest; ventral filaments not observed.</p>
<p>Collar not developed; peristomium reduced dorsally and laterally to ring, ventrally elongated as a broad triangular lobe at the base of radioles; peristomial eyes not observed. Glandular ridge on chaetigers 2 present.</p>
<p>Peristomial chaetae narrowly limbate, arranged in longitudinal row. Thoracic notochaetae arranged as a tuft on very slender narrowly limbate chaetae; thoracic uncini not easily observable in specimens available here. Abdominal neurochaetae, thin capillaries; abdominal uncini very small (difficult to observe), forming nearly complete cinctures around the body, avicular with 2 large teeth.</p>
<p>Pygidium broad conical lobe, not obvious in large specimens; pygidial eyes not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong><em>Myxicola sulcata</em> is a very distinct species, described from Ross Sea by Ehlers (1912) and considered to have distribution limited to that area (Knox and Cameron, 1998).

<p><strong><em>Desdemona? </em>sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>SEA LION: station 3MFC (with branchial crown, non-brooding); station 22 MFA (with branchial crown, brooding) and station 56MFB (branchial crown missing).</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis (based on voucher from station 3MFC). </strong>Small, extremely slender species; voucher is a complete specimen with branchial crown; body 3.8 mm long and 0.15 mm wide, branchial crown is 0.5 mm long; body with 8 thoracic and 15 abdominal segments; posterior thoracic and anterior abdominal segment elongated (much longer than wide); posterior abdominal segments short again; colour in alcohol pale yellow.</p>
<p>Branchial crown with 3 pairs of radioles and 1 pair of shorter non-vascularized ventral filaments; radioles with 5 or possibly 6 pairs of widely separated pinnules.</p>
<p>Collar is well-developed; much higher ventrally (=anterior margin of anterior peristomial ring developed ventrally as wide lobe); low dorsally with two deep dorso-lateral notches; well developed, long, narrow dorsal lip observed.</p>
<p>Glandular ridge on chaetiger 2 present. Peristomial eyes not observed.</p>
<p>Superior thoracic notochaetae long, limbate; inferior thoracic notochaetae short, simple capillaries. Thoracic neurochaetae acicular; with at least 5 teeth decreasing in size above the main fang; reducing in number from 10 in chaetiger 2 to 3 in chaetiger 8 (the last thoracic chaetiger). Abdominal uncini avicular with enlarged breast; the number constant, with 6 in chaetiger 9 and 5 posteriomost chaetigers, but the last one which only bears 1 uncinus. Anterior abdominal uncini extremely small; anterior one very narrow, arranged in about 3 rows (in frontal view), with about 6 teeth per row; posterior uncini broader, arranged in about 5 rows (in frontal view).</p>
<p>Posteriomost chaetigers gradually narrowing into well developed, rounded, triangular to cordiform pygidial lobe, terminal cirrus or pygidial eyespots not observed. Tube not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Reproduction.</strong> In several specimens a single small juvenile was found inside the branchial crown and these specimens appear to have longer and perhaps more numerous pinnules on their radioles than voucher from station 3MFS. At present, we assume this to be an adaptation that enables brooding of juveniles. No other morphological differences were observed. Brooding of eggs and larvae within the branchial crown has been linked to small body size and habitat. Of other Sabellidae known from the region, this strategy has been documented in <em>Perkinsiana antarctica</em> (Knight-Jones and Bowden, 1984; Gambi and Patti, 1999) and <em>Myxicola </em>cf.<em> sulcata </em>(Gambi et al., 2001).</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>The small size, relatively low number of abdominal segments, development of collar, lack of inferior mucronate chaetae and form of thoracic and abdominal uncini suggest these Falkland Is. specimens belong to the genus <em>Desdemona</em>Banse, 1957. However, there are also some inconsistencies, such as lack of peristomial or pygidial eyes and the number of abdominal segments while relatively low is higher (N=15) than in all other know species (up to 8).</p>
<p>This is a small genus, currently with five valid species, all with Southern Hemisphere distribution. Three of these are reported from the area - <em>D. trilobata</em> (with type locality: Falkland Islands), D. nova and <em>D. antarctica</em>. Should the generic identification be confirmed by subsequent work, specimens from Falkland Islands collected here likely represent a new species.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of known <em>Desdemona </em>species:</strong></p>
<p><em>D. ornata</em>: radioles with dark pigments, collar missing dorsally, with 8 abdominal segments only.</p>
<p><em>D. trilobata</em>: presence of two pairs of obvious persistomial eyes; only 6 abdominal segments and pair of lateral wings in posteriormost abdominal segments.</p>
<p><em>D. antarctica: </em>presence of small pair of peristomial eyes, collar with a single dorsal incision only, with 7 abdominal segments only.</p>
<p><em>D. nova ? </em></p>
<p><em>D. aniara: </em>collar similar to <em>D. antarctica, </em>radioles with 8 pairs of pinnules.</p>

<p><strong><em>Claviramus</em> sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher.</strong> INFLEX: station 1MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Small and slender species; voucher specimen complete, with branchial crown; body 2.5mm long, crown 1mm long, body 0.2mm wide; 8  thoracic and 9 abdominal chaetigers.</p>
<p>Branchial crown with 5 pairs of radioles, basally connected by a very low palmate membrane; radiole with papillae, distally ends in a well-developed flange with long filament; 2 pairs of nonvascularized ventral filaments present. (Presence/absence and structure of the lips not determined at this stage).</p>
<p>Collar most developed ventrally as high lobe, low lobe laterally and dorsally as a low lobes; margin smooth with mid-ventral shallow notch; dorsally forming two lobes that just about meet at midline. Peristomial eyes not observed. Glandular ridge on chaetiger 2 present.</p>
<p>Collar uncini limbate notochaetae. Thoracic notochaetae of two types - long, broadly limbate and shorter paleate, about 3 + 3 per fascicle. Thoracic uncini acicular with long handles, breast as a narrow swelling, positioned very close to notochaetae, 3 per fascicle, each with main fang and rows of small, diminishing-in-size teeth covering half the length of main fang. Abdominal uncini appear <em>Jasmineira</em>-like (with reduced breast), main fang surmounted by several rows of small teeth; 4 per fascicle.</p>
<p>Pygidium triangular lobe, pygidial eyes not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>The flanges on distal ends of radioles a feature clearly observed in FI specimen, are a hallmark of genus <em>Claviramus</em> (Fitzhugh, 2002). However Fitzhugh (2002) also reported abdominal uncini to be avicular, with enlarged breast. While it was not possible to observe abdominal uncini in clear lateral view in FI specimen, these do appear more of <em>Jasmineira </em>type, with reduced breast. This character requires clarification (only a single, very fragile specimen is currently available for examination). Currently, only 3 species of <em>Claviramus</em> are known (none from the geographical area investigated): <em>C. candelus </em>(Grube, 1863) from Adriatic Sea, <em>C. grubei</em> Fitzhugh, 2002 from Thailand and <em>C. oculatus</em> (Langerhans, 1884) from Madeira. The FI specimen represents a new species showing affinities with <em>C. grubei </em>and <em>C. oculatus</em> (sensu Cochrane 2000) in having filamentous ends to radioles distal to the foliaceous flanges (see discussion in Fitzhugh, 2002). It can be further distinguished from <em>C. oculatus</em> by presence of a glandular ridge on chaetiger 2. <em>Claviramus grubei</em> is marked by presence of this glandular ridge, but differs from FI specimens in possessing more abdominal chaetigers (12 versus 9) and greater number of radiolar pairs in branchial crown (7 versus 5), even though the holotypes are of the exact dimension (i.e. differences cannot be size related). This is a first record of genus <em>Claviramus</em> from South America and Southern Ocean.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher.</strong> Sea Lion: Station 41MFC</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Small sized species; voucher specimen is incomplete with 50 segments,  4mm long and 0.5 mm wide; anterior part of the body enlarged and dorsoventrally flattened, cylindrical posteriorly; colour in alcohol reddish brown, with darkest pigmentation in prostomium and prebranchial segments.</p>
<p>Prostomium slightly pear-shaped; prostomial antenna very short (not protruding beyond the prostomium), cirriform, unlike prostomium not stained (contrast well as it appears white against prostomium); nuchal organs present as short slits in posterior part of prostomium, partially covered by peristomium.</p>
<p>Branchiae from chaetiger 4, 19 pairs in voucher specimen (but variable in other specimens), first and last pair shortest, other branchiae long (overlapping at midline), tapering distally into acute tips , the last branchiae (where present) short.</p>
<p>Notopodial postchaetal lobes small, digiform in prebranchial segments, lengthening throughout, longest in mid-branchial region–about half the length of corresponding branchiae, getting small again in posterior segments.</p>
<p>Notochaetae long capillaries, most dense in anterior part of the body, some extremely long and modified lyrate (forked) chaetae, lyrate chaetae from chaetiger 5 (very difficult to observed as notochaetae very dense), becoming obvious from around chaetiger 15, 2 per fascicle; lyrates with unequal tines with long filamentous tips, both with inner edges serrated.  Neurochaetae capillaries only, most dense in anterior part of the body, some extremely long. Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>FI specimens agree most with <em>C. furcatus </em>Strelzov, 1973 descriptions in  size and shape of antenna, branchiae from chaetiger 4 and form of notopodial lobes (very long in branchial segments, getting smaller in postbranchial segments). However, the striking reddish pigmentation was not commented on by Strelzov. Neither was the presence of extremely long capillary noto- and neurochaetae (in addition to shorter ones) observed in FI specimens. Also he noted appearance of lyrate chaetae from chaetiger 3.</p>
<p>Blake (1996) provided a description of <em>C. furcatus </em>from deep water of California, but in his description of the size of notopodial lobes, reducing in size from prebranchial to branchial chaetigers, was in contrast to their description in Strelzov. Given the inconsistencies in characters descriptions and subsequent identification by various authors it is very difficult to arrive at conclusion about the identity of FI specimens without re-examining the type specimens and specimens from other localities. There is also a species of<em> Cirrophorus </em>reported from Southern Ocean–<em>C. brevicciratus</em> Strelov, 1973–which differs from FI specimen in possessing blister-like antenna (not developed in small specimens) and short notopodial lobes in branchial segments.</p>
<p>Additional work will be necessary to confirm if FI specimens with their striking pigmentation, long notopodial lobes in branchial regions and very long capillaries in fact represent a new species. In the meantime we refer the FI offshore material to <em>Cirrophorus </em>cf. <em>furcatus  </em>(Hartman, 1957) (<em>sensu</em> Strelzov, 1973). The reddish pigmentation, which is particularly pronounced in the most anterior body region, makes this species easy to distinguish from all other paranoid species in FI material.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Small sized, very slender species; voucher is the largest  with 43 segments (incomplete specimen), 6mm long and 0.3mm wide; body of uniform width throughout, segments becoming bead-like in middle and posterior segments; colour in alcohol pale yellow.<br />
	Prostomium triangular, slightly longer than wide, anteriorly blunt; prostomial antenna absent; nuchal organs present as two short slits in posterior part of prostomium.<br />

	Notochaetae long capillaries, most dense in the anterior part of the body. Modified chaetae lyrate (forked) from chaetiger 6 (very difficult to observe as notochaetae very dense), becoming easy to observe from around chaetiger 9, only one per fascicle, with unequal tines, with long filamentous tips, both tines with inner edges serrated.

<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> Only <em>P. brunnea</em> Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt, 1988 is a known <em>Paradoneis</em> species from the area (Southern Ocean), possessing three prebranchial chaetigers, short blunt form of branchiae, presence of modified lyrate chaetae only (i.e. no spines) in notopodia. However there are also differences in that FI specimens lack the brown pigmentation of <em>P. brunnea,</em> lyrate chaetae occur from chaetiger 6 (rather than 3 in P. brunnea) and possess a much smaller number of branchiae (5 observed versus 12 in P. brunnea).<br /><em>P. forticirrata</em> described by Strelzov (1973) from the deep Pacific Ocean in which first lyrate spines also occur in segment 4-6, but differs in possessing 15-17 pairs of branchiae and most importantly Strelzov described the notopodial postchaetal lobes on prebranchial segments as massive and made this important distinguishing character from other species of <em>Paradoneis</em> (Strelzov 1973, p.147). However, the accompanying drawing in Strelzov (p. 146) does not show large notopodial lobes. These are in fact similar to those found in FI specimens and also described in <em>P. brunnea</em>. A comparative table for known species of <em>Paradoneis </em>was provided by Aguirrezabalaga and Gil (2009).  However, characters such as the number of branchial pairs is variable (probably size dependent) and so we cannot exclude the possibility that, given the small size of FI specimens, they are in fact juveniles of one of these species. Additional work will be necessary to confirm if FI specimens in fact represent a new species or merely a juvenile form.</p>

<p><strong><em>Leitoscoloplos </em>sp.1</strong></p>
<p>	<strong>Vouchers specimens.</strong> Sea Lion: Station MFC1, Station 60MFA, Station 66MFC</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Vouchers three incomplete specimens, 6-9 mm long and 0.6-0.8 mm wide for 36-45 chaetigers; body cylindrical, narrowing posteriorly (Plate 1a). Colour in alcohol pale to dark yellow.<br />
	Prostomium small, sharply conical (Plate 1b). Thorax with 9 chaetigers; notopodial and neuropodial postchaetal lobes very short, knob-like in chaetiger 1-2 (Plate 1e); notochaetal lobes on chaetigers 3 - 9 digitate (Plate 1e), become long and slender (Plate 1e); neuropodial lobes on chaetigers 3 – 9 mammiform (most pronounced on chaetigers 7 – 9) (Plate 1e); no subpodal or ventral papillae. All thoracic chaetae crenulated capillaries; in thoracic chaetigers few (10-20, size dependent), arranged in single row; numerous, arranged in 2 rows in neuropodia. Abdominal notochaetae included both crenulated capillaries and forked setae, with long weakly crenulated capillaries in abdominal neuropodia.<br />
	All chaetae crenulated capillaries, few (10-20, size dependent) in notopodial, arranged in single row; arranged in 2 rows in neuropodia.<br />
	Branchiae from chaetiger 17 or 18 (Plate 1f), initially small, inconspicuous, triangular, increasing slowly in size, becoming large, strap-like and changing shape to bluntly conical with the tip curved dorsally and to pointed distally assuming spear-head shape in posterior chaetigers (Plate 1d,g);  posterior branchiae up to twice length of notopodial lobes.<br />
	Abdomen from chaetiger 10 (Plate 1e); abdominal notopodial postchaetal lobes resemble those of thorax but thinner and longer; abdominal neuropodial lobes robust,cylindrical, distally bilobed, both lobes short and blunt with outer lobe narrower (Plate 1 c,d); subpodal flange moderately developed in anterior abdominal chaetigers becoming extremely high and narrow in posterior abdominal chaetigers (Plate 1c), subpodal papillae and interramal cirri lacking. Pygidium not observed.<br />
	Remarks. Currently, five Southern Ocean species (<em>L. kerguelensis, L. kerguelensis minutus, L. mawsoni,  L. geminus </em>and <em>L. banzareae</em>) and one South American species (<em>L. chilensis</em>) in the genus <em>Leitoscoloplos</em> are known thanks to revisionary work of Mackie (1987). Particularly the Southern Ocean species tended to be “lumped” under <em>L. kerguelensis</em> as careful examination of abdomen (which is often mostly incomplete) is necessary to distinguish between different species. Of the species recorded from the region, <em>Leitoscoloplos </em>sp. 1  is most similar to <em>L. kerguelensis</em> in possessing nine thoracic segments, but it can be easily distinguished by much later start of branchiae from chaetigers 17-18 as opposed to 13-15 in <em>L. kerguelensis</em>, as well as by a combination of other characters (see the table below). Falkland Island specimens represent a new species requiring formal description.</p>

<p><strong>Syllinae sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher specimen.</strong>  SEA LION: station 19MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Voucher is a single specimen collected, complete, large and robust specimen in good condition; 45mm long and 3.5mm wide (including parapodia) for about 300 chaetigers; all segments very short (crowded); body in alcohol dark yellow with distinct reddish-brown pigmentation dorsally on about 50 chaetigers (most pronounced on first 30 chaetigers), dorsally cirri also heavily pigmented.</p>
<p>Prostomium pentagonal bearing three antennae and two palps. Palps short (about the same length as prostomium), relatively narrow triangular lobes, basally free from each other. Antennae long, distinctly articulated, positioned anteriorly to eyes; lateral antennae slightly shorter than median antenna. Eyes present, 2 pairs of large purple eyes in trapezoid arrangement (anterior and posterior pairs located very close to each other). Pharynx not everted. First segment achaetous laterally with a pair of long, distinctly articulated tentacular cirri (similar to antenna).</p>
<p>Parapodia uniramous, conical; with long, distinctly articulated dorsal cirri of the two types, often alternating –  longer (with around 40 articulations) heavily pigmented and shorter ones, without pigmentation; ventral cirri only weakly articulated, slightly shorter than the tip of parapodia, inserted basally. In mid-body chaetigers parapodia with 3 aciculae not protruding through integument, all with blunt rounded tip. Chaetae all compound falcigers, about 6 per fascicle; all with short, curved, distally unidentae blades, with serrated margins. Pygidium rounded lobe with 2 quite short (extending over the last 10 very crowded segments) articulated lateral anal cirri.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> Although FI specimen is in a good condition, assigning it to a named species is difficult due to taxonomic complexities in the absence of observation of proboscis. We are referring this species to subfamily-level morphospecies Syllinae sp. 1.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Voucher is a complete specimen; very small, slender species; 3mm long and 0.35mm wide for 28 chaetigers, pygidium damaged. Integument papillated; colour in alcohol pale yellow. Prostomium about twice as wide as long bearing three antennae and two palps. Palps fused along their length, short. Antennae smooth, arising nearly at same level, bottle-shaped, of equal size. Two pairs of large red eyes present, arranged in almost straight line, inner pair large, posterior pair smaller; pair of small red eyespots present, positioned anteriorly on prostomium. Pharyngeal tooth located near anterior margin. Proventricle short, extending through chaetigers 2-4.</p>
<p>First segment achaetous laterally with a pair of smooth, short, bottle-shaped tentacular cirri. Parapodia uniramous, short but distinct, conical. Dorsal cirri on chaetiger 2 absent, in other chaetigers bottle-shaped (similar to antennae and dorsal cirri) in anterior chaetigers, becoming progressively elongated and narrow in posterior chaetigers.</p>
<p>Chaetae observed were falcigers with slender, slightly curved, unidentate blades; chaetae often broken off, simple chaetae likely broken off. Acicula clearly observed in posterior chaetigers, where solitary, acuminate. Pygidium damaged.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Falkland Islands specimens agree well with <em>Sphaerosyllis perspicax</em> Ehlers, 1908 described from South Georgia, which probably belongs to <em>Erinaceusyllis </em>according to San Martin (2005). Specimens agree in that anterior dorsal cirri are strongly inflated at their bases and absent form chaetiger 2, the eyes and the antennae are both arranged in line, the palps are completely fused all along their length. Females brooding eggs dorsally, by means of capillary notochaetae were observed in material from Falkland Islands.</p>

Body elongated, tapering; body surface papillated; yellowish in ethanol. Prostomium bluntly rounded, fused to peristomium; with median antenna and three pairs of lateral prostomial appendages; all very short, digitiform.</p>
<p>Two macrotubercles per chaetiger; each dorsal to parapodia; spherical to pear-shaped, provided with terminal papilla. From chaetiger 2 posteriorly two microtubercles per chaetiger, dorsal to macrotubercles, with a basal collar and a long terminal papilla. Papillae on all body surfaces. About four irregular rows of about 10 small papillae per each row covering dorsum, relatively densely distributed, additionally about 2 papillae per row between macro- and micro tubercle; in venter about 10 small papillae in about 2-3 irregular rows.</p>
<p>Parapodia uniramous; conical. Parapodia of first chaetiger in ventral position; following parapodia lateral. Parapodia with about 10 digiform papillae on all surfaces. Strongly curved hooks in first chaetiger (one per parapodium), visible in ventral view. Chaetae about 4 per fascicle, many broken off, and those remaining clearly simple, appearing somewhat spear-shaped with small subdistal boss, distal end falciform, pointed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>The specimens are consistent with genus <em>Sphaerodorum</em> Örsted, 1843 as it possesses 2 rows of macortubercles, large hook on chaetiger 1 and simple chaetae, unlike similar genus <em>Ephesiella </em>Chamberlin,1919 which has compound chaetae. This genus is represented in the region by two species <em>Sphaerodorum indutum  </em>Fauchald, 1974 known from Scotia Sea to Peter I Island and <em>S</em>. <em>olgae</em> Moreira & Parapar, 2011 from Bellingshausen Sea.

Venter sparsely covered with small papillae forming 2 regular rows, each with 4-5 papillae in each row.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> Falkland Islands specimens belong to group of <em>Spaherodoropsis </em>with more than 4 rows of macrotubercles (Borowski, 1994). Several species with similar number and arrangement of macrotubercle are known, including those known from the region. Important characters that differentiate between species, related to number and patterns formed by papillae on ventrum and parapodia (see Moreira et al., 2004 for details). This species is very similar to <em>Sphaerodoropsis</em> sp. 1 also recorded from Falkland Islands in its number and arrangement of macrotubercles, but the presence of multiple papillae on surface of macrotubercles differentiates <em>Sphaerodoropsis </em>sp. 4.

<p><strong>Remarks.</strong>  The presence of nuchal crest on posterior part of prostomium as well as arrangement and type chaetae and form of dorsal and ventral cirri agree well with <em>Pseudoscalibregma bransfieldium</em> (Hartman, 1967). The reticulation has not been described by Hartman (1967) or in re-description by Blake (1981), but images provided by both authors suggest that the anteriormost segments lack distinct reticulation although these are distinctly bi-annulated as in Falkland Islands’ specimens.

<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Voucher is a complete specimen; very small, slender species;  3.5 mm long and 0.4mm wide for 30 chaetigers. Integument of body smooth, but palps papillated; colour in alcohol yellow. Prostomium short, only slightly wider than long. Antennae not observed (assumed missing). Palps very short and compact, fused along their length, provided with small papillae. Two pairs of relatively large red eyes present, in trapezoid arrangement, with anterior and posterior pair very closely together (almost appearing as a single eye), posterior pair circular, anterior pair cup-shaped; presence of additional eyespost not confirmed. Proventricle extending through chaetigers 4-6.  First segment achaetous tentacular cirri not observed (assumed missing). Parapodia uniramous, short but distinct, conical. Dorsal cirri likely present in all chaetigers (missing on several anterior segments, but observed on chaetigers 2 and 3), where present bottle-shaped throughout the body becoming only slightly more elongated in posterior chaetigers. Chaetae often missing (broken off), one simple chaeta usually observed, the rest of chaetae compound falcigers. Acicula clearly observed in posterior chaetigers where solitary, acuminate. Pygidium damaged.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Falkland Islands specimens have integument of body smooth (uncharacteristically for the genus), but small palps appear to be heavily papillated. <em>Prosphaerosyllis palpopapillata</em> (Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1992) described from Antarctic Peninsula (63º16.40'S, 63º42.78'W), from 300m depth and intertidal Brazilian species <em>Prosphaerosyllis isabellae</em> (Nogueira, San Martín & Amaral, 2001) are the only known species  exhibiting such characters. However palps appear to be much reduced in Falkland Island specimens and form of antennae and dorsal cirri cannot be confirmed.

<p><strong>Voucher specimen.</strong> SEA LION: station 40MFC.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong>  Voucher is a complete specimen with 35 segments (divided into two fragments). Prostomium bilobed, with cephalic peaks; ceratophore of median antenna in anterior notch, style of median antenna papillate, slightly inflated subdistally, then abruptly tapering; lateral antennae inserted ventrally with styles papillate, tapering. Anterior pair of eyes situated dorsolaterally on widest part of prostomium, posterior pair dorsally near hindmargin of prostomium. Palps papillate, tapering.</p>
<p>Tentaculophores inserted laterally to prostomium, each with notochaetae and a dorsal and ventral tentacular cirrus with styles of cirri slightly inflated subdistally, then abruptly tapering, the dorsal cirri longer than ventral cirri. Second segment with first pair of elytra, biramous parapodia, and long buccal cirri.</p>
<p>Fifteen pairs of elytra, all eytra present. Outer lateral margin and adjacent surface of elytra with dense fringe of long, filiform papillae; elytral surface covered with conical microtubercles, posterior half of elytra with numerous conical macrotubercles; macrotubercules distally mulifid.</p>
<p>Cirrigerous segments with dorsal cirri with cylindrical cirrophore, style papillate, tapering. Ventral cirri with smooth, tapering style. Parapodia biramous; notopodia with elongate acicular lobe; neuropodia larger than notopodia; tips of noto- and neuroacicula penetrating epidermis. Notochaetae stouter than neurochaetae; notochaetae with distinct rows of spines and blunt tip. Neurochaetae uni – and bidentate; unidentate falcate, with rows of spines distally; bidentate with slender secondary tooth (often abraded). Pygidium with a pair of very long (reaching back over 10 segments), thin, papillate anal cirri.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong>  Falkland Islands specimen cannot be assigned to any known <em>Harmothoe </em>species review recently form the Southern and Atlantic Oceans (Barnich et al. 2006; Barnich and Fiege, 2010) and likely represent a new species. Of the <em>Harmothoe </em>species known from the region, Falkland Islands specimen is most similar to <em>Harmothoe fuligineum</em> (Baird, 1865) in having elytra with have fringe of long papillae on outer margin. However, the macortubercules in the known species are distally entire, rounded, while in Falkland Islands specimens these are multifid.</p>

<p><em><strong>Glycera</strong></em> <strong>sp. 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher.</strong> SEA LION: station 46MFA, 64MFB and 57MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Voucher incomplete; small to medium sized species; the largest voucher with body 9mm long for 38 chaetigers. Mid- body segments distinctly triannulate. Long and slender conical prostomium consisting of indistinct rings; terminal ring with four appendages. Proboscis with two types of papillae, both with subapical tufts of cilia: 1. numerous long, slender digitiform papillae, lacking pigmentation, without obvious ridges (using light microscopy); 2. less numerous, isolated shorter and broader, digitiform papillae, lacking pigmentation. Terminal part of proboscis with four hook-shaped jaws arranged in a cross and accessory ailerons with triangular base (sensu Böggemann, 2002).</p>
<p>First two pairs of parapodia uniramous, following parapodia biramous. Two triangular to digitiform prechaetal lobes and one shorter, broad, distally rounded, somewhat truncated postchaetal lobe. Dorsal cirri oval to globular, positioned on body wall far above parapodial base. Ventral cirri short digitiform. Branchiae not observed.  Noto- and neuropodia each with a single acicula. Notochaetae slender, straight or weakly recurved capillary with serration one side. Neurochaetae compound spinigers with blades of different lengths, with serration one side. Pygidium uknown.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> Off <em>Glycera </em>species reviewed and described by Böggemann (2002, 2009) species with triangular aileron bases, tend to possess longer and slender digitiform  proboscidial papillae as well as shorter broad, ovoid papillae. However in Falkland Island specimens, both type of papillae are rather slender and conical, with the numerous type particularly long and slender as otherwise seen in <em>Glycera tesselata</em>.  However bases of ailerons of <em>G. tesselata</em> are deeply incised, not triangular. Species of <em>Glycera </em>commonly reported from the region - <em>Glycera kerguelensis</em> McIntosh, 1885 (considered synonym of <em>Glycera capitata</em> by Böggemann (2002)) has shown cryptic diversity in molecular analysis (Schüller, 2011; Brasier et al., 2016). Glyceridae reported from the region are clearly in need of a revision and we currently assign Falkland Islands’ specimens to morphospecies <em>Glycera</em> sp. 2.</p>

<p><strong><em>Galathowenia  </em></strong><strong>sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher specimens. </strong>SEA LION: station 6MFB, 9MFB and 51MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Few large and robust and several small and slender specimens were collected, which are here considered as adult and juvenile examples of the same species; all in tough (hard to open) tubes composed of particles and internally lined with membrane. Voucher is a relatively large, robust specimen 17mm long, about 0.8mm wide, posteriorly incomplete. Prostomium collar-like, short (similar in length to chaetiger 1); no eyes. Thorax composed of 3 uniramous chaetigers of varying length: 1<sup>st</sup> short, 2<sup>nd</sup> longer (1.5 – 2x the length of 1<sup>st </sup>chaetiger), 3<sup>rd</sup> short again. Abdominal segments very long (till end of body, which is an incomplete fragment). Notochaetae long, coarsely serrated capillaries; neuropodial hooks from chaetiger 4, arranged in many (about 20) alternating rows in anterior abdomen and in about 13 irregular rows in posterior abdomen. Form of uncini similar in anterior and posterior abdomen, all bidentate, with equally sized, slender, widely separated teeth arranged dorsally and ventrally; manubrium straight (slightly larger just below the teeth, but not forming subdistal knob). Pygidium uknown.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong><em>Galathowenia scotiae</em> (Hartman, 1978) – described with prostomium missing  by Hartman (1978) who reported there are only 2 instead of 3 thoracic (uniramous) chaetigers. Based on Hartman’s drawing the chaetiger 2 (which she considered chaetiger 1) is about the same length as the following chaetiger, however in key provided by De León-González & Sanchez-Hernández, 2012 and in Capa et al. 2012 <em>G. scotiae</em> is cited as having 2<sup>nd</sup> thoracic segment twice the length of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>, which corresponds well with FI specimen. However<em> G. scotiae </em>differs from Falkland Islands’ specimens in that the manubrium of uncini has an abvious enlarged subdistal knob and two unicnal teeth appear to be close together. Importantly, there is a “groove” present between 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> chaetigers in <em>G. scotiae</em> and this feature was not unambiguously confirmed in Falkland Islands’ specimens. Parapar (2003) suggested: “There is a need for a revision of the genus <em>Galathowenia</em>, and particularly of the sibling species characterized by the absence of eyes, the presence of a thoracic slit between the first and second setigers, and a similar head and hook shape”. The most similar species outside the geographical area is <em>G. piltzi</em> described by Blake (2000) from 92m, off California, which possesses similar types of hooks and sparse serration on notochaetae as seen in Falkland Islands specimens, but the 3 thoracic segments are all of the same length. With current evidence we assign Falkland Islands specimens to <em>Galathowenia </em>sp. 1.</p>
<p><strong>Other Galtahowenia species known from the region, differ in following (main) characters:</strong></p>
<p><strong>G. longicollaris (Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1989</strong>) – with 3 thoracic chaetigers, its prostomium is much (about 4x) longer than the first segment.</p>
<p><strong>G. joinvillensis (Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1989)</strong> – with only 2 thoracic chaetigers.</p>
<p><strong><em>G.</em></strong> <strong><em>antarctica </em></strong><strong>Cantone & Di Pietro 2001 </strong>– with 2 short thoracic chaetigers.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher specimen</strong>. NIMROD : station N8FB and VINSON WEST: 2MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Body short, flattened, oval and coiled up;  2.2mm long and 1.8mm wide for 13 chaetigers.  Prostomium with 5 antennae, four paired antennae on anterior of prostomium, short and digitform, median antenna slightly larger than others, in two sections, with short stout basal section and a longer slender terminal. Caruncle extending to chaetiger 4. A pair of relatively large eyes present, situated between chaetigers 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Parapodia biramous with dorsal, lateral and ventral cirri. Branchiae present from chaetiger 1, cirriform, one per segment throughout arising just behind and laterally to dorsal cirri; dorsally cirri longer and more slender than accompanying branchiae. Other parapodial appeandaes include lateral cirrus and ventral cirrus.  Chaetae very well developed, long and numerous; notochaetae of one type, forked with smooth long prongs; neurochaetae all bifurcate with coarsely serrated long prongs; ringent chaetae absent.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong>  This small species is consistent with <em>Euphrosinopsis </em><em>crassiseta</em> Kudenov (1993) in having single cirriform branchia arising just behind and laterally to dorsal cirri and lacking ringent chaetae.   </p>
<p>However previous records of this species are from much greater depth - 3697m in Weddell Sea rather than ~1000m as in Falkland Islands specimens, which we refer to  <em>Euphrosinopsis </em><em>cf. </em><em>crassiseta.</em> Kudenov (1993) provided a full description of this species as well as descriptions of other euhprosinid and amphinomid species known from the area and we recommend this publication for further details.

<p><strong>Voucher specimen.</strong> LOLIGO: station 1MFA; INFLEXIBLE:  station 2MFB and 5MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Even the largest voucher (LOLIGO 1MFA) is a small, fragile, but complete specimen with 38 chaetigers, 7mm long and 0.8mm wide (including parapodia).</p>
<p>Prostomium with 5 articulated antenna, with the median antenna longest, the shortest ventralmost pair bi-articulated; with a pair of very small red eyes located postero-laterally on prostomium. Peristomium broad, with a pair of short tentacular cirri. Branchiae present from chaetiger 3 to chaetiger 16 branched (with single filaments from chaetiger 3 to chaetiger 8; maximally with 2 filaments), distinctly longer than notopodial cirri in anterior and middle branchial chaetigers, with single short filament in posterior most branchial chaetigers. Ring-shaped bases in posterior notopodia not confirmed. Chaetae including smooth limbate chaetae and compound bidentate falcigers present in all chaetigers, additionally bidentate subacicular hooks, appearing singly from chaetiger 11; pectinate chaetae not clearly observed. Pygidium with two long lateral and one very short dorsomedial anal cirri, all slender, without articulations. Maxillary formula not examined (specimen small and fragile).</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.  </strong>Small size and underdeveloped branchiae suggest these specimens may be juveniles (see also Orensanz, 1990). <em>Eunice pennata </em> is a cosmopolitan species with wide distribution, including previous report from the region (see Orensanz, 1990 and more recently Quiroga and Levin, 2010 for detailed discussion). Fauchald (1992) mentioned that besides branchiae starting on chaetiger 3, the unique feature of the species is the presence of ring-shaped bases in posterior notopodia  (see also Quiroga and Levin, 2010), which was not confirmed in Falkland Islands specimens, likely due to their small size. Given that type locality of <em>Eunice pennata </em> is Norway (Oslofjord), we prefer to assign Falkland Islands’ specimens to  <em>Eunice </em>cf. <em>penata </em>until molecular evidence becomes available.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong>  Long slender specimen 33mm long and about 1mm wide for around 170 chaetigers. Prostomium flattened with mid-dorsal furrow or depression, long, triangular, distally rounded. No eyes. Posterior chaetigers maldanid-like with a collar and distinct proximal edge. Parapodia well developed throughout, including in anterior chaetigers. Chaetae simple limbate and large protruding, yellow aciculae. Jaws not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong>  The well-developed parapodia of the anterior end affiliated this specimen with <em>Drilonereis</em> sp. reported by Orensanz (1990). This character also distinguishes the specimen from <em>D. tenuis</em>, in which the parapodia of anterior end are very small and which was also found to be present in Falkland Islands (see entry <em>Drilonereis tenuis</em>). Other species known from the wider region (off Chile) include <em>D. chilensis</em> Hartmann-Schröder, 1965 and <em>D. viborita</em> Orensanz, 1990.

<p><strong><em>Cossura </em></strong><strong>sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher specimen. </strong>SEA LION: station 56MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Small, slender species, all specimens fragmented. Voucher specimen incomplete composed of anterior fragment with about 20 thoracic chaetigers and about 5 damaged abdominal chaetigers (the only example long enough to show transition between thorax and abdomen), about 2.5 mm long and 0.25mm wide. Abdomen and pygidium unknown; few damaged abdominal segments observed, these appear to be inflated, bead-like. Colour in alcohol pale yellow. Prostomium longer than wide, anteriorly bluntly rounded (appear almost slightly truncated). Branchial filament inserted posteriorly on chaetiger 2 (near the border of chaetiger 2and 3). Chaetiger 1 with uniramous parapodia, all the next segments with biramous parapodia. All chaetae hirsute capillaries with smooth shafts; arranged in two rows. Thickened chaetae present in about 20 (=thoracic) segments, tapering into long, thin tip.  Few abdominal segments observed lacking thickened chaetae.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Even though this species was very abundant (~400 specimens collected) not a single complete specimen was encountered. Specimens appear to be fragmented at transition between thorax and abdomen, with mid and posterior part of the body (=abdomen), which are diagnostic, not observed. However only few known species possess thickened chaetae in thoracic chaetigers as is the case in Falkland Islands’ specimens. This feature was also described for <em>Cossura heterochaeta </em>(type locality: Argentina), <em>C. rostrata</em>,  <em>C. ginesi</em> and <em>C. hutchingsae. </em><em>Cossura ginesi </em>differs by the shape of prostomium with anterior extension. <em>C. hutchingsae</em> has inflated pads in thorax and the segmental borders drawn forward dorsally. <em>Cossura</em> <em>heterochaeta </em>and <em>C. rostrata </em>have a conical prostomium, which is rounded in Falkland Islands specimen. Further, there are two types of anterior thickened chaetae—with arista and without it—in <em>C. heterochaeta</em> and Falkland Islands’ specimens have more thoracic segments – about 20, instead of 12–14 in <em>C. heterochaeta</em>. Summary of <em>Cossura </em>species known from the area can be found in table below. Until better preserved specimens become available, we assign Falkland Island specimens to morphospecies <em>Cossura</em> sp. 1.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher specimen. </strong>SEA LION: station 11MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Voucher is a small sized, incomplete specimen; 14mm long and 0.6mm wide for 11 chaetigers long fragment; preserved specimen light pink in colour. Chaetigers 1-9 relatively short (but longer than wide) and distinctly separated by deep intersegmental grooves; chaetigers 10 and 11 elongated, rest of the fragment too damaged. Chaetiger 8 with a distinct semi-circular glandular pad on dorsum as typical for this genus, pad is almost short (less than half of the chaetiger 8).               </p>
<p>Prostomium with cephalic plaque; cephalic rim extremely low; without any notches or dips near mid-anterior peak, palpode not developed. Nuchal organs straight, slightly diverging anteriorly, extending throughout 3/4 of length of cephalic plaque, bordering a very low lying cephalic keel, which extends throughout the length of the cephalic plaque.</p>
<p>Notochaetae capillaries of two types – long, smooth, very narrowly limbate chaetae and shorter, very thin capillaries.

<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>SEA LION: station 38MFA.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.  </strong>Voucher specimen posteriorly incomplete 7.0 mm long and 1.5 mm wide (including parapodia), for 25 chaetigers (damaged). Alcohol preserved material  pale yellow with golden setae and black aciculae. Prostomium rectangular (slightly wider than long), with pair of long, thin, triangular antennae lying closely against palps. Palps tapering, about the same length as antennae, with large palpophores. Eyes absent. Two pairs of tentacular cirri of similar length, all rather short. Pharynx inverted (not observed).</p>
<p>Parapodia bi-ramous, with notopodia slightly shorter than neuropodia. Dorsal cirrus slender tapering, only slightly longer than notopodial ligule, their cirrophores appear expanded on most chaetigers. Notopodia with elongate  prechaetal ligule and short, blunt postchaetal lobe. Neuropodia (mid body) with bluntly rounded postchaetal lobe and elongate digitiform precheatal ligule. Ventral neuropodial ligule digitiform, elongated. Ventral cirri not branched on chaetigers 1-2, from chaetiger 3 bifid till end of the fragment, ventralmost cirrus tiny on chaetiger 3 (easily overlooked), about ½ the length of primary cirrus in chaetigers 4-5, only slightly subequal in length to primary cirri on subsequent segments.Notopodial chaetae arranged in 2 bundles on either side of prechaetal ligule. Neuropodial chaetae similarly arranged. Chaetae consist entirely of homogomph spinigers with finely serrated blades; chaetae straw coloured. Narrow transverse dorsal ridges connecting the notopodia present from chaetiger 5 till end of the fragment. The rest of the body and pygidium uknown.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Genus <em>Ceratocephale</em> is characterised by bifid ventral cirri (this characters is also shared with genus <em>Gymnonereis</em>, which additionally also has bifid dorsal cirri). The appearance of the double ventral cirrus together with characters such as – presence or absence of eyes, appearance of expanded dorsal cirriophores, presence of dorsal ridges, form of chaetae and characters derived from proboscis. The differences appear to be rather subtle (see Table 1. for comparison). Falkland Island specimens agree most with <em>C. hartmanae </em>having bifid ventral cirri from chaetiger 3 and all chaetae homogomph spinigers, but this species is unique in having mid-dorsal flaps in median body region. While the presence of such flaps cannot be assessed in Falkland Islands material (all specimens very short) two species differ in chaetiger in which dorsal ridges start. Currently we prefer to assign Falkland Island specimens to morphospecies <em>Ceratocephale</em> sp. 2.</p>

<p><strong><em>Brada </em></strong><strong>sp. 1</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Voucher specimens.</strong> SEA LION: station 35MFB, 18MFA and 29MFB.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong>  Medium to large sized species. The largest voucher complete specimen with 35 chaetigers , 45mm long and 7mm wide at  widest point. Body fusiform, tapering posteriorly. Body greyish, incrusted with particles particularly dorsally giving it rusty appearance. Body densely and irregularly covered with small papillae; papillae incrusted on dorsum (not visible), on ventrum papillae more exposed, appearing short and cirriform. First chaetiger with prolonged capillary chaetae, about 12 chaetae on each side.  In subsequent segments notochaetae few, about 2 per fascicle, long, thin capillaries. Neurochaetae acicular, straight, amber-coloured, about 5 per fascicle.  Large rounded nephridial papillae present ventrally to neuropodia of chaetiger 5.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong>  Several species of <em>Brada </em>have been recorded from the region with <em>Brada mamillata </em>Grube, 1877 described from Kerguelen Is. and later reported by Hartman (1953) from Falkland Islands in 7-8m water depth.  Most species were poorly described or assumed to belong to species with type locality in Northern Europe. Revision of species of <em>Brada </em>from the region is needed. Currently we ascribe the specimens from Falkland Islands to morphospecies <em>Brada </em>sp. 1.</p>

<p><strong>Pectinariidae sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher.</strong> ENDEVOUR: station E4FB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Small sized specimen, body conical in shape, voucher complete, 4mm long (including the palelae) and about 0.4mm wide; not in the best condition slightly desiccated.  </p>
<p>Rim of cephalic veil appears smooth or at the best with very shallow indistinct dense cerration. Cephalic veil completely free from operculum, forming a slender triangular lobe around the peristomial palps. Raised opercular margin well developed, smooth. Operculum with 9 pairs of long amber-coloured paleae, with blunt tips. Two pair of slender, elongated tentacular cirri and two pairs of branchiae on segments 3 and 4 present (specimen too dessicated to clearly observed these clearly).</p>
<p>Chaetigers 1 to 3 (segments 5 to 7) with notopodia and notochaetae only. Chaetigers 4 to 17 biramous with both notopodia, neuropodia, and notochaetae and uncini.  Notochaetae from chaetiger 4 include smooth winged capillaries, and capillaries with finely serrated margins. Notochaetae from chaetiger 14 with finely hirsute surfaces. Uncini  forming “paw-like” pattern with irregular rows of small teeth above the main. Posterior scaphe and abdomen distinctly separated. Posterior 5 segments fused to form scaphe. Scaphe slightly longer than broad, with narrow elongated dorsal papilla. Scaphal hooks present, 6 pairs, stout, distally blunt.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong>  Hutchings and Peart (2002) provided a review of genera of Pectinariidae, with 5 valid genera.  The combination of the characters observed in Falkland Island specimens (see Table 1. below) differs from the know genera, suggesting it may represents a new genus (or need to amend generic definition). It is affiliated most closely with genus <em>Petta</em> Malmgren, 1866 in having smooth cephalic veil, smooth dorsal opercular rim and 14 pairs of neuropodia, however its scaphe is distinctly separated from the abdomen. Further, teeth of uncini are not neatly arranged in 1 (or 2 as common in some genera) row, but instead from “paw-like” pattern with irregular rows of small teeth above the main fang as known in Ampharetidae (SEM is needed to fully establish the form of uncini).  Ideally, a greater number of well-preserved specimens need to be examined in order to diagnose this genus, as it is not clear if some variation observed here is an artefact of desiccation of the voucher specimen. At present, we suggest to assign this specimen to morphospecies Pectinariidae sp. 1.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher. VINSON WEST: station 5MFB.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.  </strong>Voucher specimen complete; 4mm long and  1.2 mm wide (including parapodia) for 33 chaetigers. Body dorso-ventrally flattened; preserved specimens pale yellow without pigmentation. Pharynx inverted in all specimens but visible through body wall. Prostomium about three times wider than long; rounded anteriorly; with a pair of anterior antennae and a median antenna located on middle of prostomium, all antennae similar in length and shape, short, globular to digiform. A pair of palps present ventrally on anterior margin of prostomium, slender and slightly longer than antennae. Segment 1 achaetous with a single pair of short, ovoid to digiform tentacular cirri. Chaetigers 1–3 uniramous. Notopodia and neuropodia similar in shape and size, both long and cylindrical with well developed lobes; dorsal and ventral cirri not observed. Notochaetae present from chaetiger 4; about 20 long capillaries with serrated edge, serration widely spaced. Neurochaetae about 30 composite spinigers (4 of those much shorter than others), with long unidentate blades with finely serrated edge. The last three chaetigers very reduced. Pygidium rounded lobe, no cirri observed (missing?).</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Genus <em>Lacydonia</em> contains 10 valid species (see comparative table in Magalhães et al. 2012), broadly divided into occulate and annoculate groups. Three species are known from the area: <em>L. mikrops</em> Ehlers, 1913; <em>L. oculata </em>Hartman, 1967 (=synonym of <em>L. antarctica</em>) and <em>L. gorda</em> Hartmann-Schröder, 1993. Of these only the last species lacks eyes and is therefore most similar to Falkland Island specimen. Falkland Island specimen appear to differ from  <em>L. gordia </em>in development of notopodia (these are long in FI specimen not truncated). However as Magalhães et al. (2012) noted that most known species of <em>Lacydonia </em>are known only through a single or few type specimens and ontogenetic variation is unknown.  Hartmann-Schröder’s (1993) description is also rather brief. Without molecular data it is difficult to currently establish if these constitute the same species. Given the morphological differences observed here, we assign Falkland Island specimens to morphospecies <em>Lacydonia</em> sp. 1 until more evidence becomes available.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher. LOLIGO: </strong>station L11FB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.  </strong>Voucher specimen posteriorly incomplete 4.0 mm long and 1.0 mm wide (including parapodia), for 22 chaetigers. Alcohol preserved material, pale yellow in colour with golden setae and black aciculae. Prostomium rectangular, with pair of long, thin, triangular antennae lying closely against palps. Palps tapering, about the same length as antennae, with large palpophores. Eyes absent.  Two pairs of tentacular cirri with the longest extending to the beginning of chaetiger 3.  Pharynx inverted (not observed).</p>
<p>Parapodia bi-ramous, with notopodia slightly shorter than neuropodia. Dorsal cirrus slender tapering, longer than other parapodia appendages, their cirrophores expand, becoming fully expanded from around chaetiger 10. Notopodia with elongate prechaetal ligule and short, blunt postsetal lobe. Neuropodia (mid body) with bluntly rounded postchaetal lobe and elongate digitiform precheatal ligule. Ventral neuropodial ligule conical (subequal in length to primary ventral cirrus). Ventral cirri bifid throughout (present from chaetiger 1 till end of the fragment), with ventralmost cirri about half the length of primary cirri.</p>
<p>Notopodial chaetae arranged in 2 bundles on either side of prechaetal ligule. Neuropodial chaetae similarly arranged. Chaetae consist of mostly homogomph and few sesquigomph spinigers with finely serrated blades. Chaetae far more numerous on chaetigers 3-9 than on subsequent chaetigers; chaetae straw coloured.  Narrow transverse dorsal ridges connecting the notopodia present from chaetigers 14 till end of the fragment. The rest of the body and pygidium uknown.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Genus <em>Ceratocephale</em> is characteristic by bifid ventral cirri (this character is also shared with genus <em>Gymnonereis</em>, which additionally also has bifid dorsal cirri). The appearance of the double ventral cirrus together with characters such as – presence or absence of eyes, appearance of expanded dorsal cirriophores, presence of dorsal ridges, form of chaetae and characters derived from proboscis. The differences appear to be rather subtle (see Table 1. for comparison).  Currently we prefer to assign Falkland Island specimens to morphoscpecies <em>Ceratocephale</em> sp. 1, as differences from known species were observed as are summarised in Table 1. below.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>. Vouchers posteriorly incomplete; small sized – larger voucher 5mm, width up to 0.5mm including parapodia for 53 chaetigers. Eyes absent. Proboscis partially everted; paragnaths present (their distribution not determined), dark jaws present.  For form of parapodia and chaetae see attached plates. Pygidium uknown.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Both voucher specimens are very small and we cannot exclude that they are juveniles. The patterns of paragnaths was not determined as proboscis was only partially extended. Type specimen of <em>Neanthes typhla</em> (Monro, 1930) described from South Georgia is present in NHM collection and was checked. The following differences were noted, but given that Monro’s specimen was much larger, it is not clear if observed difference can be contributed to size differences:</p>
<p>- the posterior most dorsal cirrus is longer than the others in Falklands Is. specimen, but of similar size or only slightly longer in <em>N. typhla</em></p>
<p>- lobes of parapodia are protruding into sharp tips in Falkland Is. specimens, but are more oblique/rounded  in <em>N. typhla</em></p>

<p align=""left""><strong>Voucher.  </strong>INFLEXIBLE: station 5MFB.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Diagnosis.  </strong>Medium sized species; voucher specimens in two fragments; 12mm long (in total) and 0.8mm wide; with about 40 segments. Body elongated, cylindrical, tapering posteriorly; densely covered with papillae, covered with light brownish sediment; segmentation visible through sediment coat and papillation.</p>
<p align=""left"">Anterior end broadly rounded, without cephalic cage; oral structures not visible (withdrawn); eyes absent. Parapodia not developed, chaetae appear to emerge directly from body wall. Notochaetae long,  slender, few (1-2 per ramus) observed, mostly missing; distally narrowed into long fine tip; appearing smooth (even under high magnification). Neurochaetae up to 5 per fascicle; all composite, with the blade falcate, slightly serrated along the edge, unidentate, with curved hinged tip. Pygidium damaged, not observed.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Remarks. </strong>Acrocirridae are well represented in the waters from the region (see table below; tables comparing all known species in genera <em>Flabelligella</em> and <em>Flabelligena</em> are available in Gillet (2001) and Aguirrezabalaga and Ceberio (2006). Gillet (2001) sates that genus <em>Flabelligella </em>has cross-barred notochaetae, while genus <em>Flabelligena </em>possesses serrated or spinulose notochaetae.  Cross-barred chaetae are not present in Falkland Island specimen, but neither spinulose or serrated chaetae were confirmed with certainty as chaetae appear more or less smooth even under high magnification. However these appear more allied to those of genus <em>Flabelligena</em> to which the specimen is assigned here. Many other characters separating the species within this group are difficult to observe as they tend to be withdrawn or missing. The specimen from Falkland Islands is here assigned to morphospecies <em>Flabelligena</em> sp. 1.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher specimen.</strong> TOROA: station 10TFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Specimens from 10TFA x 27 and 40 mm in length with 129 chaetigers and 187 chaetigers respectively. Long slender body with slight reddish colour in preserved specimens. Prostomium flattened with mid-dorsal furrow or depression, long, triangular, distally rounded. No eyes. Posterior chaetigers maldanid-like with a collar and distinct proximal edge. Parapodia small, with prechaetal lobes larger than prechaetal.</p>
<p>Mandibles small. Five pairs of maxillae; Max I with four teeth gradually decreasing in size distally; Max II with 8 – 12 teeth; Max III one long tooth anteriorly then 4 smaller teeth decreasing in size distally; Max IV one large tooth sometimes with 1 or 2 small teeth, Max V with one pointed tooth/edge. Maxillary carriers fused at anterior end with two long thin branches extending distally.</p>
<p>Chaetae simple limbates and large black aciculae.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> The maldanid-like form of the chaetigers in mid and posterior chaetigers is very distinctive. However, Orensanz (1990) remarks that this genus is not well studied so other species may share this characteristic.</p>
<p>This species has been recorded from the Falkland Islands and southern Atlantic slopes of South America at depths of 20–660 m.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Small species, voucher whole worm 7mm long with ~56 chaetigers. Rounded prostomium with a pair of short moniliform antennae; palps not observed (damaged?). Parapodia with notopodia represented by a pointed aciculum and neuropodia with a range of chaetae, dorsal cirri relatively long, about as long as parapodia, each with distinct terminal cirrostyle; ventral cirri short with rounded tip, situated toward outer end of parapodia.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> The worms in the study are very small and isolating and describing the inner jaws is difficult. The species of this complex are in any case difficult to distinguish, requiring careful examination of the maxillae, the distribution of compound hooded hooks and their length to width ratio (see Orensanz, 1990, for a detailed discussion).</p>
<p>The other species complex which might be found in the area is the <em>L. magalhaensis </em>complex. The <em>L. kerguelensis/cingulata </em>Group can be distinguished by the longer more pointed prostomium whereas the<em> L. magalhaensis </em>complex has a short rounded prostomium.

<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Voucher specimen 9mm with 29 chaetigers. Body thick and robust. Prostomium a long cone with rounded tip. Nuchal papillae not observed (three median papillae often seen situated on the distal edge of the prostomium and peristomium).</p>
<p>Mandibles flat, white, X-shaped. Max I with large distal extension; Max II with three low teeth; Max III concave inner surface; Max IV larger than III, irregularly rectangular, white in centre; Max V missing.</p>
<p>Hooded hooks compound in anterior chaetigers 1–13 becoming simple thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> Orensanz (1990) remarks that the genus needs to be revised and does not provide a key to species in the Southern Ocean. This species appears to be distinct based on the shape of the maxillae, distribution of the hooded hooks and the transition from compound to simple chaetae. Further study of the various species is required to determine taxonomic boundaries.

<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Specimens fragmented, Sealion 1MFC specimen ~30mm in length with 175 chaetigers. Prostomium short, pointed. Two achaetigerous segments. Postchaetal lobes conical, short.</p>
<p>Maxillary carriers constricted about a quarter way down, pointed and pips separated; Max I large arched without supplementary teeth, Max II with three to four large teeth; Max III small semi-triangular with small tooth at apex near junction with Max IV. Max V and VI fused forming a broad rectangular plate, small tooth emerges from inner border of the plate.</p>
<p>Chaetae comprise of hooded hooks, limbate capillaries, and yellow aciculae. The hooded hooks arise from chaetiger 1 or slightly further back, initial chaetae resemble limbates but have small teeth/hooks developing at the tip.

<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> The key features of this species as pointed out by Orensanz (1990) are the very delicate hooded hooks in the anterior chaetigers which can only be distinguished by examination with a high powered microscope and by the fusion of Max IV and V. This species has a wide geographic and bathymetric distribution, being recorded from around the Southern Ocean, off New Zealand and Chile, with a depth range of upper bathyal to 6000 m.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> There are four species in South American waters with six of more pairs of branchiae: <em>D. carolinae </em>Aguilar-Camacho & Salazar-Vallejo, 2011 (13 pairs with spines from chaetiger 14); <em>D. choromytilocola </em>Carradco, 1977 (13 pairs with spines from chaetiger 11); <em>D. fistulicola </em>Ehlers, 1901 (5–7 pairs with spines from chaetiger 9) and <em>D. meridiana </em>Elias & Rivero, 2009 (7-18 pairs with spines from chaetiger 8). The FI species differs from these species in the type of spine, which in this species is a simple spine without any spoon-like expansion of the tip.</p>

Body widening gradually in thorax then narrowing at junction with abdomen; dorsally flattened; ventrally a shallow groove runs from the mid to posterior thorax down body. Thoracic chaetigers much wider than long, crowded, in abdomen chaetigers longer, as wide as long or longer, before becoming crowded on the segments in the pygidium.</p>

<p>Methyl Green Staining Pattern. Band ventral under the prostomium extending into the mouth, narrow bands along lateral and ventral edges of thoracic chaetigers.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> <em>Aphelochaeta</em> sp. 5fB is a common species in the Sealion samples. It closely resembles <em>A. </em>sp. 5fA, differing in being more dorso-ventrally flattened and in the arrangement of the third annulation and dorsal tentacles. In mixed samples this species can often be distinguished by a full gut obvious in posterior thoracic and anterior abdominal chaetigers and, in fresh material, by the bases of branchiae in the posterior thorax showing as bright red dots.</p>
<p><em>A. </em>sp. 5fB can be distinguished from the <em>Aphelochaeta malefica</em> Elias and Rivero, 2009 by the arrangement of the dorsal tentacles, third annulation of the peristomium and MGSP. There are similarities to <em>Aphelochaeta longisetosa </em>(Hartmann-Schröder, 1960) but there appears to be differences in the arrangement of the annualtions and dorsal tentacles, however there are no images for this species and so definitive assessment can only be made after examination of the type. The shape of the body suggests similarities with <em>Aphelochaeta williamsae</em> Blake, 1996 from California but the FI specimen differ in MGSP which have banding extending laterally while in <em>A. williamsae</em> they do not. <em>A.</em> sp. 5fB differs from the other Californian species in that the dorsal thorax is flattened and ventrally more rounded, whereas most of Blake’s species are dorsal-ventrally rounded or have a rounded (hump-backed) dorsal thoracic shape.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Sealion specimen 16 MFC fragment 16.3mm long with 79 chaetigers, 60 MFA 11mm long with 67 chaetigers. Body widening gradually in thorax region, dorsally hump-backed, thoracic chaetigers crowded, narrow, wider than long, becoming longer and more flaccid in abdominal chaetigers but again becoming wider than long towards pygidium; ventrally, groove present from mid thorax down the body.</p>
<p>Prostomium conical, blunt-pointed. Peristomium wider than long, domed, three annulations seen laterally and horizontally. Dorsal tentacles separated, situated laterally on distal edge of peristomium and first chaetiger, dorsal and proximal to first branchiae. Following branchiae situated dorsal to notochaetae separated by at least one branchial diameter from dorsalmost notochaetae.</p>
<p>Chaetae positioned laterally in thoracic segments but becoming more ventral in subsequent segments. Thoracic chaetae relatively long thin capillaries; notochaetae of two sizes, long capillaries of approximately up to 10 chaetigers in length, giving specimens a ‘hairy’ appearance, long chaetae appear from anterior thoracic chaetigers and occur down body into the abdominal chaetigers, shorter capillaries less than 6 chaetigers in length also present; thoracic neurochaetae slightly shorter; 7 to 10 notochaetae and 6 to 8 neurochaetae per fascicle. Abdominal notochaetae fewer in number than neurochaetae and less dense than in thoracic chaetigers.</p>
<p>Pygidial segments widening before narrowing and tapering towards anus, distinct ventral groove observed, terminal anus with low lobes, ventral lobe large extending with an acute tip.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks. </strong><em>Aphelochaeta </em>sp. 5fA is common in the Sealion samples. It closely resembles <em>A. </em>sp. 5fB having similar MGSP but differs in the shape of the body, with <em>A. </em>sp. 5fA having a hump-backed thorax while in <em>A. </em>sp. 5fB the thorax is flat; long notochaetae occur from the anterior chaetigers of <em>A. </em>sp. 5fA but in <em>A.</em> sp. 5fB such long chaetae are found in posterior thoracic chaetigers. Such differences appear to be consistent and so it has been decided to consider them as separate species. Further specimens and genetic analyses are probably needed to confirm their status.</p>
<p>In terms of known <em>Aphelochaeta </em>species, <em>A. </em>sp. 5fA differs from <em>A. malefica </em>Elias and Rivero 2009, in the body shape which expands in thoracic chaetigers of the FI specimen while the species from the River Plate has a body more uniform in width, the peristomium is much shorter in the FI specimens only as long as wide whereas in <em>A. malefica </em>the peristomium is longer that wide in the position of the dorsal tentacles and first branchiae and that the latter also has the peristomium extending back displacing the first chaetiger, while <em>A. </em>sp. 5fA the junction is not displaced proximally. The MGSP for the two species is also different. The FI specimens have only diffuse staining in the peristomium and prostomium while <em>A. malefica</em> has these areas darkly stained.</p>
<p><em>A. </em>sp. 5fA appears to resemble the description given by Hartmann-Schröder (1960) for <em>A. longisetosa. </em>However, there were no images provided and some of the descriptions of the characters are not sufficient to distinguish or otherwise the two species. It has been decided to maintain them as separate until it is possible to examine the types.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks. </strong><em>Aphelochaeta </em>sp. 1 is characterized by the position of the dorsal tentacles, the shape and posture of the prostomium, MGSP. Two species of <em>Aphelochaeta</em> have been recorded from the region–<em>A. longisetosa </em>(Hartmann-Schröder, 1965) from Chile, <em>A. malefica </em>(Elias and Rivero, 2009) from Argentina. The FI specimen differs from <em>A. longisetosa</em> on the position of the dorsal tentacles which in the Chilean species are more lateral and separated, close to the chaetae; the notochaetae are longer than the neuro while in the FI specimens they are approximately the same length. Hartmann-Schröder does not provide any information on the methyl green staining patterns–a technique which has only become common in the last decade. The FI species differs from <em>A. malefica</em> because the peristomium does not extend back into the first chaetiger as in the specimens from the River Plate. Also the MGSP differs between the two species.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> The lack of distal chaetigers makes designation of this species as a <em>Chaetozone</em> difficult. The main character which suggest it belongs to <em>Chaetozone </em>are the banana-shaped chaetae in the abdomen which are often seen in other species in proximal abdominal chaetigers. The shape of the prostomium is reminiscent of <em>Chaetozone</em> and the domed extension of the peristomium has been recorded in several <em>Chaetozone </em>species, i.e.<em> C. bathyala </em>Blake, 2015<em> C. bansei </em>Blake, 1996, <em>C. gracilis </em>(Moore, 1923), <em>C. hedgpethi </em>Blake, 1996. However, such a topology is not restricted to <em>Chaetozone, </em>with species of <em>Caulleriella</em> and <em>Monticellina </em>also having a domed peristomial extending back.

<p>Prostomium conical and pointed. Peristomium domed, short, wider than long, annulation difficult to see. Dorsal tentacles situated on distal edge of peristomium, dorsal to first branchiae; first branchiae on achaetigerous segment proximal to first chaetigerous segment. Subsequent branchiae in line with first and situated above notochaetae.</p>
<p>Thoracic chaetae all capillaries; notochaetae with some long capillaries, up to 9 chaetigers in length, approximately 7 per fascicule, neuropodial capillaries shorter, some very much shorter to 2 chaetigers in length, 5 to 7 per fascicule. Proximal abdominal chaetigers with short, curved, pointed spine-like chaetae in neuropodia and longer spine-like chaetae in notopodia together with occasional long capillaries. Acicular spines starting about half to two thirds down body, distally forming complete cinctures; a mix of acicular and more slender thin tipped chaetae, no particular pattern observed.</p>
<p>MGSP. Dark stained band on prostomium, diffuse over rest of body.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong><em>Chaetozone </em>sp. 2 differs from the other FI <em>Chaetozone </em>species in the MGSP, the arrangement of the dorsal tentacles and first branchiae and the arrangement of the spines in abdominal chaetigers.</p>
<p>In terms of species recorded in the region, <em>Chaetozone </em>sp. 2 differs from <em>Chaetozone</em> <em>pinguis </em>Hartman 1978, in body shape which is not as inflated as Hatman’s species and the prostomium is pointed not blunt. The acicular spines on <em>Chaetozone</em> sp. 2 are not recurved as described by Hartmann-Schröder (1965) for <em>C. curvata. </em>Augener’s (1932) species <em>C. andersenensis </em>was based on a specimen which was not in good condition so comparison is difficult. Augener describes the dorsal tentacle as arising on the boundary between the peristomium and chaetiger 1, with the first branchiae on chaetiger 1. This pattern differs from <em>Chaetozone </em>sp.2 where the first branchiae occurs on an achaetigerous segment. Augener also describes the prostomium as being pushed forward with a blunt tip similar to <em>Cirratulus cirratulus. </em>The prostomium in the FI specimens is pointed.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Voucher specimens</strong> INFLEXIBLE: station 2MFA; ENDEAVOUR: station E4FA.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Complete specimens 8.3mm long with 34 chaetigers. Body inflated anteriorly, widest at junction of thoracic and abdominal chaetigers; anterior abdominal chaetigers rounded becoming slightly dorso-ventrally flattened segments. Ventral groove in posterior thoracic region (may be a fold due to inflated body). Pygidium with large rounded ventral lobe.</p>
<p>Prostomium rounded, blunt. Peristomium as long as wide or slightly longer than wide, with three annulations. Dorsal tentacle situated on a narrow achaetigerous segment immediately distal to peristomium; first branchiae situated on same achaetigerous segment but ventral to dorsal tentacle. Branchiae situated above notochaetae.</p>
<p>Thoracic chaetae all capillaries; emerging from low mounds, short approximately 2 to 3 chaetigers in length, 4 to 6 chaetae in each fascicule in thoracic region. Acicular spines starting about one third to half way down the body; not forming cinctures in distal chaetigers, fascicules are separated; 3 to 4 long spines per fascicule with one to two thin capillaries in proximal abdominal chaetigers, but distal chaetigers without capillaries.</p>
<p>MGSP. Faint bands on prostomium and peristomium, diffuse staining on body.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>This is a distinctively shaped species, in particular the blunt shape of the prostomium and the inflated body are not often found in <em>Chaetozone. </em>However, the form and arrangement of the dorsal tentacles and first branchiae on an achetigerous segment is commonly found in the genus as are the acicular spines in abdominal chaetigers. The shape of the body and prostomium separate this species from the others in the FI samples.</p>
<p><em>Chaetozone</em> sp. 1 resembles <em>Chaetozone pinguis</em> Hartman, 1978 in the shape of the body and rounded prostomium. However <em>C. </em>sp. 1 does not have the acicular spines starting in the thoracic chaetigers as Hartman records for <em>C. pinguis </em>nor is the arrangement of dorsal tentacle and first branchiae the same<em>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Vouchers</strong>. SEALION: stations 1MFB and 18MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Large species, 106mm long 10mm wide. Dorso-ventrally flattened and tapering at each end to a blunt point, body wide with crowded chaetigers, much wider than long, no obvious differentiation between thoracic and abdominal regions, dorsal groove/furrow proximally. Ridge running down mid-line in abdominal chaetigers. Rear end of body tapering sharply, pygidium simple terminal surrounded by low lobes.</p>
<p>Prostomium wide, with rounded free edge. Prostomium with three annulations, approximately the same size. One pair of dorsal tentacles situated laterally on the first chaetiger, lying dorsal to the notochaetae. First branchiae on chaetiger 2. Subsequent branchiae in line with first, extending down only on anterior third part of body.</p>
<p>Chaetae all simple capillaries arising on low buttons in anterior chaetigers. Notochaetae both long and short chaetae; long chaetae up to 9+ chaetigers in length, very thin and flexible with fine tips; short chaetae slightly thicker. Only short capillaries in neurochaetae, with fine serrations along edge; 5–6 chaetae in noto and neuropodia.</p>
<p>MGSP. Solid stain over the dorsal prostomium and peristomial areas; ventrally on the prostomium a band runs into the mouth; band of stain on each chaetiger, particularly strong over the parapodia area.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> Despite this species being large and in some samples common, placing it  in a genus has been difficult. Superficially it resembles a multi-branchiate species of <em>Cirratulus. </em>There are species of <em>Cirratulus</em> which have reduced or only one pair of dorsal tentacles, e.g <em>C. concinnus</em> Ehlers, 1908<em>. </em>However, species of <em>Cirratulus</em> have distinct spines in the neuropodia whereas this species has none. Using available keys results in an identification of <em>Aphelochaeta –</em> the pair of dorsal tentacles and only capillary chaetae. Yet the FI species’ over all appearance is unlike any <em>Aphelochaeta</em> species. More work is needed and comparison with other cirratulid species in the area is required to resolve this dilemma.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher </strong><strong>specimens.</strong> VINSON WEST: stations 38MFA, 1MFA and 1MFB.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Specimen incomplete, 9mm with 23 chaetigers. Body cylindrical, slightly inflated at junction between thoracic and abdominal regions, no gutters/furrows observed, dorsal surface slightly raised. Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p>Prostomium blunt, wide and short. In some specimens nuchal organs observed. Peristomium slightly longer than wide with three similar sized annulations. Dorsal tentacles situated dorsally arising on the edge of the peristomium. First branchiae not on an achaetigerous segment but arising on chaetiger 1. Subsequent branchiae align with first branchiae.</p>
<p>Chaetae in first chaetigers short about 1 to 2 chaetigers in length, subsequent chaetigers with a mix of long and short chaetae, 6-7 capillaries in each fascicule. Long chaetae also found on abdominal chaetigers but in lower numbers than thoracic chaetigers. No modified chaetae observed.</p>
<p>MGSP. Prostomium and peristomium deeply stain, except the nuchal organs and ventrally around the mouth, distinct lateral bands in proximal chaetigers, gradually fading in distal chaetigers; ventrally the bands extend across the body but with a distinct clear y-shaped region running down from each side of the mouth and joining in the mid-line.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> The specimens from the current study agree in basic shape with the type of <em>Tharyx epitoka </em>Monro, 1930. However, Monro’s specimen is very obviously an epitoke as it is full of eggs whereas the FI specimens are not. In both the FI specimens and the holotype no modified chaetae were observed which calls into question the generic designation of the species.</p>
<p>The body-shape of this species, the staining pattern and the chaetal signature distinguish this species from the other FI cirratulids.</p>

<p>Phyllodocidae collected from Falkland Islands represent species-rich group with at least 10 species (including one species complex) recorded. However, their abundances are low, with each species often represent by one or few specimens, often in imperfect condition (those from deeper-waters often small and fragile). The identification and corresponding descriptions reflect the paucity of well-preserved material and therefore contain some uncertainties. More material, including live specimens (for taxonomic importance if pigmentation in live specimens see Nygren and Pleijel, 2011) as well as molecular evidence will be necessary to fully diagnose these species. Proboscis was dissected (due to rarity and fragility of specimen) and was only observed when everted.  Key given by Pleijel (1993) was used to identify Phyllodocidae to genus level.</p>

"<a href=""/node/564"">Trichobranchidae Malmgren, 1866</a>"," <p><strong>Trichobranchidae Malmgren, 1866</strong></p>
<p>Recent taxonomic work revealed many new species of Trichobranchidae (particularly in genus <em>Terebellides </em>Sars, 1835), from worldwide areas (e.g. Hutchings and Peart, 2000; Gagaev, 2009; Parapar et al., 2011; Parapar et al. 2015), including South America and South Atlantic (Bremec and Elias, 1999; Schüller and Hutchings, 2012). Revisionary works clarified the status of <em>Terebellides stroemii</em> (Parapar and Hutchings, 2015) as well as some commonly reported species from the Southern Ocean (Parapar and Moreira, 2008). New characters were identified or gained importance (Hutchings and Peart, 2000). There is therefore up to date taxonomic information available, although new species are likely to be discovered. Falkland Island specimens of Trichobranchidae were sadly often damaged and in bad condition, preventing unambiguous identifications/conclusions. The diversity of this group in Falkland Islands is likely much higher than species reported here, particularly in small-sized species from 1000m depths. The species recorded are summarized in table below.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher.</strong> SEA LION: station 9MFC.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.  </strong>Small-sized species; voucher specimen short and spindle-shaped; 1.2mm long and 0.3mm wide 13 chaetigers.</p>
<p>Prostomium with five digitiform appendages, including a pair of palps, in ventralmost position; a pair of lateral antenna, similar in shape and size to palps; and a median antenna, shorter (two thirds) than lateral antennae and club-shaped; a pair of tentacular cirri similar in shape and size to lateral antennae and palps.</p>
<p>One transverse rows of macrotubercles per chaetiger. Four sessile and distally rounded, enlarged globular macrotubercles per row; macrotubercles arranged in groups of 2, each group located dorsal to parapodia; macrotubercles rather indistinct, low lying.</p>
<p>Dorsum sparsely covered with small papillae, arranged in 2 more or less regular rows across each segment, about 5-6 papilla per row. Venter covered with scattered small papillae, arrangement similar to the one in dorsum.</p>
<p>Uniramous parapodia elongated, cylindrical; ventral cirri well developed, digiform. Parapodial papillae present; exact arrangement not established, but at least 3 small papillae easily observed.</p>
<p>Chaetae compound, unidentate, about 8 per fascicle.</p>
<p>Pygidium with digiform mid-ventral anal cirrus and a pair of lateral anal cirri.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong>. This species belongs to the largest group in genus <em>Spaherodoropsis</em> (species with 4 rows of macrotubercles). Careful comparison of papillation of venter and parapodia with known species will be necessary to establish the identity of this species. It resembles <em>S. parva  </em>(Ehlers, 1913) but Falkland Island specimen differs in lack of eyes as well as greater level of papillation. Until further study we have assigned this species to morphospecies <em>Sphaerodoropsis</em> sp. 3.</p>

<p><strong><em>Sphaerodoropsis </em>sp. 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher.</strong> ENDEAVOUR: station 9MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.  </strong>Small sized but robust species; voucher specimen short and maggot-like; 2.2mm long and 1mm wide for about 25 chaetigers. Prostomium inconspicuous.</p>
<p>Two transverse rows of macrotubercles per chaetiger. About 15 sessile and distally rounded, globular macrotubercles in each row; macrotubercles relatively small, mostly of similar size, tightly packed, arranged in a zigzag to regular pattern on dorsum (dorsum almost completely covered); distally macrotubercle with a small red spot, internally a red stalk observed through integument; additional single row of such macrotubercles also present ventrally to parapodia, in a few segments two such macrotubercles present ventrally.</p>
<p>Uniramous parapodia extremely short, cylindrical with; ventral cirri short, digiform. Chaetal fascicles arranged in a curved transverse row behind acicular lobe, numbering 6–10 chaetae per fascicle.</p>
<p>All chaetae semi-compound; blades as long as wide; with an outer distal thin spine in some chaetae; shaft with widened distal end and saw-toothed spinulation, continuing along most of blade length. Pygidium inconspicuous.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong>. This species in easy to distinguish by a very high number of macrotubercle (around 15), which are slightly smaller than in most other species. Although <em>Sphaerodrop</em>sis represent a genus with large number of species, only few species possess such a large number of macrotubercles as well as similar type of chaetae. These include: <em>S. minuta</em> (Webster & Benedict, 1887); <em>S. spissum</em> (Benham, 1921); <em>S. multipupillata</em> (Hartmann-Schroder, 1974); <em>S. paracapense</em> (Hartmann-Schroder, 1974) and <em>S. polypapillata</em> Hartmann-Schroder & Rosenfeldt ,1988, with the latter species described from the Southern Ocean. Falkland Island specimen appears to differ in possessing reddish pigmentation distally on macrotubercles. Further work will be needed to compare type material of existing species, but it is likely that Falkland Island specimens represents a new species. For now, we assign this specimen to morphospecies <em>Sphaerodoropsis</em> sp. 2.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis.  </strong>Small sized species; voucher specimen short and maggot-like, tapering anteriorly and posteriorly; 2mm long and 0.3mm wide for 15 chaetigers. Six sessile and distally rounded, enlarged globular macrotubercles in each of the two transverse rows per chaetiger; macrotubercles spread out (not tightly packed) in a zig-zag pattern on dorsum (dorsum easily visible); the lateralmost macrotubercles often smaller than others. Uniramous parsapodia short, cylindrical with basal papillae; ventral cirri short, digiform; chaetae compound, unidentate. Venter covered with scattered small papillae and with one large rounded papilla on ventral to parapodia of chaetiger 6.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong>. Falkland Island specimens belong to group of <em>Sphaerodoropsis</em> with more than 4 rows of macrotubercles (Borowski, 1994). Several species with similar number and arrangement of macrotubercle are known, including those known from the region. Important characters that differentiate between species, related to number and patterns formed by papillae on ventrum and parapodia (see Moreira et al., 2004 for details). While papillae on the ventrum of  Falkland Islands are present, further work would be needed (ideally with the help of SEM) to establish their pattern and compare this with the known species. For now, we assign this specimen to morphospecies  <em>Sphaerodoropsis</em> sp. 1.</p>

<p>Ventral cirri about as long as postchaetal lobes; parapodia without papillae; chaetae compound, unidentate. Pygidium with medioventral anal papilla about as long as lateral cirri.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong>. Falkland Island specimens strongly resemble <em>Sphaerodoropsis macrotubercula</em> Böggemann, 2009 described from Angola Basin, 5493m. Currently there are no obvious morphological characters that could distinguish between two morphotypes, with the biggest difference being their bathymetrical distribution. We are unable to currently resolve if these represent the same species without the help of molecular data.</p>

<p><strong><em>Ephesiella?  </em></strong><strong>sp. 1</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. INFLEXIBLE: station 2MFB.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Medium-sized species with elongated, distally tapering body; voucher specimen 20mm long, 0.8 mm wide, for about 80 chaetigers. Body long, tapering distally; body surface papillated; yellowish in ethanol.</p>
<p>Prostomium bluntly rounded, fused to peristomium; with median antenna and three pairs of lateral prostomial appendages; all very short, digitiform. Two macrotubercles per chaetiger; each dorsal to parapodia; spherical to pear-shaped, provided with terminal papilla. From chaetiger 2 posteriorly two microtubercles per chaetiger, dorsal to macrotubercles, with a basal collar and a long terminal papilla. Papillae on dorsum and parapodia, but venter smooth. Papillae covering dorsum sparsely distributed, forming regular rows across dorsum; about 2 papillae between macro- and microtubercle and then about 10 papillae across the dorsum; the number of rows these papillae form difficult to ascertain (at least 2 easily observed).</p>
<p>Parapodia uniramous; conical. Parapodia of first chaetiger in ventral position; following parapodia lateral. Digitiform chaetal lobe, arising dorsally among chaetae, projecting beyond acicular lobe. Ventral cirri digiform, surpassing acicular lobe tip. Parapodia with about 10 small papillae, sparsely distributed on all surfaces. Recurved hooks in first chaetiger (one per parapodium), visible in ventral view. Chaetae about 4 per fascicle, almost all broken off, few remaining ones appear compound.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Generic assignment of this specimen is uncertain due to lack of clearly observable chaetae. Genera <em>Sphaerodorum</em> Örsted, 1843 and <em>Ephesiella</em> Chamberlin, 1919 differ in simple chaetae in the former and compound chaetae in the latter. The specimen here is currently assigned to genus <em>Ephesiella</em> Chamberlin, 1919 as few remaining chaetae appeared compound (although these were imbedded in the integument). These genera are represented in the region by two species: <em>Ephesiella antarctica</em> (McIntosh, 1885<strong>),  </strong><em>Ephesiella muhlenhardtae</em> Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1988 and <em>Sphaerodorum olgae</em> Moreira & Parapar, 2011. A better preserved specimen (with chaetae) from Falkland Islands, as well as the type specimens of the <em>Ephesie</em>lla species need to be examined in order to establish the papillation of body surface and parapodia. For now, this species is assigned to morphospecies <em>Ephesiella</em>? sp. 1.</p>

Eyes absent. Palps long, extending to about segment 10, very slender, tapering.</p>
<p>Segment 2 with inflated elytrophores. Segment with pair of short bulbous cirrophores (?); styles missing (?). No branchiae observed.  No parapodial ctenidia observed, but ventral ctenidia observed from about chaetiger 13. Parapodia distinctly biramous; stylodes absent.</p>
<p>Notopodia only slightly smaller than neuropodia, long, cylindrical; with distinct supraacicular process  - short, rounded, blunt. Neuropodia long, cylindrical. Ventral cirri of 2nd segment inserted basally on neuropodium, longer than in subsequent segments (almost reaching tip of neuropodium); on other segments inserted medially, slender, elongated (but not reaching the tip of neuropodia).

<p>Notochaetae numerous of 3 types: 1. short, thin capillaries; 2. Short to long slender, finely spinous chaetae; 3. long, more robust, chaetae with wider blade, coarsely serrated on one side. Neurochaetae all spinigers, with smooth stems, blades with alternating spines on both side, distally tapering into long slender tips; blades variable in length. </p>
<p><strong>Original remarks (see also updated remarks).</strong> Voucher specimens lack elytra, therefore their generic assignment cannot be confirmed with certainty. But combination of  median antenna with auricles, presence of branchiae and spinigerous neurochaetae suggest it may belong to genus <em>Neoleanira </em>Pettibone, 1970.<em> Neoleanira magellanica</em> (McIntosh, 1885) is a species known from the region (type locality: Tierra del Fuego), but Falkland Islands' specimens are small and not all characters can be established with certainty. At present we assign these to morphospecies Sigalionidae sp. 1.</p>
<p><strong>Updated remarks. </strong>Following the intial examination on which description above is based, a better specimens (large, with elytra intact) became avalable. It was confirmed that elytra is transluscent to milky, with entire smooth margin and surface and clavate ventral ctenidia are present from mid body onwards. Falkland Islands specimens agree well with <em>Neoleanira magellanica </em>(McIntosh, 1885) and are therefore re-assigned to this species.</p>

<p><strong><em>Glycera</em> sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>VINSON WEST: station 1MFA and  38MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Voucher incomplete; medium sized species; body 20mm long for 60 chaetigers. Mid- body segments distinctly triannulate. Conical prostomium consisting of about 15 indistinct rings; terminal ring with four appendages. Proboscis with two types of papillae, both with subapical tufts of cilia: 1. numerous elongated, digitiform papillae with brown pigmentation, but without obvious rides (using light microscopy); 2. Less numerous shorter and broader, ovoid papillae with lighter brown pigmentation and with faint “finger-print” like pattern, composed of 3-4 wide rings. Terminal part of proboscis with four hook-shaped jaws arranged in a cross and accessory ailerons with slightly arched base (sensu Böggemann, 2002).</p>
<p>First two pairs of parapodia uniramous, following parapodia biramous. Two triangular to digitiform prechaetal lobes and one shorter, broad, distally rounded, somewhat truncated postchaetal lobe. Dorsal cirri oval to globular, positioned on body wall far above parapodial base. Ventral cirri slender triangular to digitiform, shorter than postchaetal lobes. Branchiae not observed (absent?).  Noto- and neuropodia each with a single acicula. Notochaetae slender, straight or weakly recurved capillary with serration one side. Neurochaetae compound spinigers with blades of different lengths, with serration one side. Pygidium uknown.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Commonly reported <em>Glycera kerguelensis</em> McIntosh, 1885 considered synonym of <em>Glycera capitata</em> by Böggemann (2002) has been shown cryptic diversity, with three clades revealed in molecular analysis of Schüller (2011). However Falkland Island specimens do not belong to <em>G. kerguelensis</em> as they possess ailerons with slightly arched base not triangular as defined by Böggemann (2002). In revision of Glyceridae carried out by Böggemann (2002) only <em>G. oxycephala</em> Ehlers, 1887 has similar ailerons, but can be distinguished by having both types of proboscidial papillae with distinct finger-print like pattern with several narrow rings. Falkland Island specimens likely represent a new species and should be formally described. Until such time we assign it morphospecies <em>Glycera</em> sp. 1.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher.  </strong>LOLIGO: station 14FA.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Voucher specimen complete with 16 chaetigers, measuring 5mm long and 0.4mm wide.</p>
<p>Body slender, cylindrical without obvious segmentation except for segments 1–4, which form an oval unit distinct from the rest of body. Epithelium smooth, shiny to iridescent, translucent, single tiny visible papilla can be observed laterally on most segments.  </p>
<p>Prostomium retracted surrounded by one achaetous peristomial ring.  Parapodia biramous, not well developed throughout, best developed and present as lateral transverse welts in segments 1–4, inconspicuous in middle and posterior segments. Chaetae on chaetigers 1-4 of two types – spines and capillaries; elongated pale to yellowish, fairly straight, distally blunt sigmoid spines numbering 2 per fascicle, each with accompanying capillary. Chaetigers 5 to 16 with 1 fine slender capillary and 1 blunt-tipped spine; spines shorter than those on chaetiger 1-4 (tips often broken) and extending beyond end of body.  Anus terminal, usually withdrawn within bilobed last segment. Boundary between distal part of last segment and pygidium indistinct, with midventral cleft.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> With 16 segments, last segment with spines extending beyond end of body and segments 1–4 of holotype without bidentate modified chaetae, the specimens agrees with <em>Laubieriopsis  brevis. </em>Good summary of the taxonomic problems of this species following problematic description by Hartman (1967) was given by Petersen (2000). It is possible that more than one species exist within what Petersen considered <em>Laubieriopsis brevis </em>complex (see Petersen, 2000 for details).</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong>  Small-sized, slender species, represented by two complete specimens about 10mm long and 0.5mm wide for 18 thoracic and about 30 abdominal chaetigers; body tapering posteriorly; chaetiger 1-10 short, getting progressively longer from chaetiger 11; then segments increasingly shorter and crowded towards pygidium.<br />
	Prostomium compact; tentacular membrane surrounding the mouth as an enlarged convoluted lobe buccal tentacles missing. Expanded oblong to rectangular structure (=“lower lip” sensu Hutchings and Peart 2000) below tentacular membrane. Eyespots absent.</p>
<p>
	Lateral lappets on chaetigers 1–5, anterior margins separated from body wall; a swollen glandular area particularly pronounced in chaetiger 1. Nephridial papillae or nephridial pores not observed (using light microscopy).</p>
<p>
	Branchiae arising as a single structure from segments 3–4, consisting of a single mid-dorsal stalked structure made up of 4 lobes; lobes free of each other; anterior pair larger, the posterior pair shorter than anterior pair; lamellae of branchial lobes loose (=not compacted).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eighteen pairs of notopodia (segments 3–20), compact, rectangular; notopodia of segment 3 (=1st pair of notopodia) much smaller than on subsequent segments; notopodia of segments 4-7 (2nd – 5th pair) appear slightly smaller than those on subsequent segments. All notochaetae simple, narrowly limbate capillaries.</p>
<p>Neuropodia present from chaetiger 6 (segment 8). Thoracic neuropodia as sessile pads; abdominal neuropodia as erect pinnules. Neuropodial uncini in single rows throughout. First thoracic neuropodia (chaetiger 6) with 4-5, sharply bent, geniculate acicular hooks with acute, slightly upward turned tips. Second and all subsequent thoracic neuropodia with about 6 uncini per torus; uncini long handled denticulate hooks with main fang large and surmounted by a crest of smaller denticles.

	Voucher 1MFA: First thoracic neuropodia (chaetiger 6) with 10, sharply bent, geniculate acicular hooks with acute, slightly upward turned tips. Second and all subsequent thoracic neuropodia with about uncini per torus; uncini long handled denticulate hooks with main fang large and surmounted by a crest of smaller denticles. About 25 abodminal uncinigers. Abdominal uncinigers with about 35 avicular uncini per torus, each uncinus with 3–4 teeth above main fang surmounted by number of smaller teeth. Pygidium damaged.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong>  Currently, only three valid species in genus Terebellides are known from the area<em> T. kerguelensis</em>,  <em>T. longicaudatus</em> and<em> T. bisetosa</em>.  Recent revisionary work (Parapar and Moreira, 2008) concluded that<em> T. minutus</em> Hessle, 1917 (type locality: Straits of Magellan - Tierra del Fuego) and <em>T. antarcticus</em> Hessle, 1917 (type locality: Graham Land, Southern Ocean) are synonyms of<em> T. kerguelensis </em> (McIntosh, 1885).<em>  Terebellides kerguelensis</em> (McIntosh, 1885) was redescribed by Parapar and Moreira (2008) and is characterized by the presence of an anterior branchial extension (5th lobe), lateral lappets in five anterior thoracic chaetigers, segmental organs in chaetigers 1, 4 and 5, and first thoracic acicular neurochaetae sharply bent with pointed tips.<br /><em>Terebellides longicaudatus</em> is characterized by the presence of wide lateral lappets in chaetigers 1 and 2 (segments 3 and 4), first thoracic notopodium which is greatly reduced and large thoracic uncinigerous tori provided with many (45 to 80) uncini and numerous abdominal chaetigers.<em> Terebellides bisetosa </em> Hartmann-Schröder, 1965 known from Chile can be distinguished by having  2 types of notochaetae. Falkland Islands specimens (1st notopodium smaller, with strongly bent and acutely tipped spines, with about 10 uncini per thorus, lobes on chaetigers 1- 5) are therefore most similar to<em> T. kerguelensis</em>. However the number, size and fusion of branchial lobes cannot be assessed with confidence as these are often damaged in Falkland Island material. Only one specimen had branchial lobes attached and only 3 lobes were observed with unpaired 3rd lobe free and much smaller than anterior pair of branchial lobes. This branchial arrangement is not consistent with <em>T. kerguelensis</em>, but it is not clear if the small lobe/s are missing/regenerating or if this is a true branchial form. Segmental organs in chaetigers 1, 4 and 5 present in<em> T. kerguelensis</em> were not confirmed in Falkland Islands specimens (under light microscopy). It is possible that Falkland specimens represent a new species, but better preserved material will be necessary to establish this. The specimens are assigned here to morphospecies Terebellides sp. 2.</p>

Voucher 3MFB small, slender specimen 3mm, slender, incomplete (only 15 chaetigers longs = thoracic segments only, abdomen missing entirely); colour in alcohol pale yellow, no pigmentation. Eye absent. Anterior structures typical for the genus with prostomium inconspicuous lobe; tentacular membrane projecting anteriorly when fully expanded; upper lip projecting anteriorly, with pair of expanded peristomial lateral lobes forming 3-lobed structure; lower lip expanded, forming conical, longitudinally ridged, proboscis. Buccal tentacles short.</p>
<p>Branchiae missing (scars observed); 2 pairs, on segments 2–3; inserted laterally with posterior pair inserted more laterally than anterior pair, notochaetae and uncini begin on the same segment (=segment 6), thoracic uncini all acicular, of the same type on all thoracic segments. All notopodia of similar size. All notochaetae of similar size and structure, simple, smooth-tipped, narrowly limbate capillaries.

<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>The presence of conical ridged proboscis, thoracic long-handled uncini and 15 thoracic chaetigers assign Falkland Island specimens to genus <em>Artacamella</em> Hartman, 1955. While one specimen is badly damaged and the other is incomplete (abdomen is entirely missing), the comparison with only 4 known species of <em>Artacamella</em> suggest, that these represent a new species (see comparative table below). However better preserved material will be necessary in order to formally describe this species, which is here assigned to morphospecies <em>Artacamella</em> sp. 1. At the same time, this is a first record of genus <em>Artacamella</em> for the FI region, but also its first record from deeper waters as known species so far had only shallow water distribution (see table below). <em>Artacamella </em>can be easily confused with genus <em>Trichobranchus </em>Malmgren, 1866 when proboscis retracted (see Hutchings and Peart, 2000; Muir  2011).</p>

<p>Branchiae absent. Parapodia biramous, reduced, inconspicuous anterior in chaetigers becoming large and well developed in middle and posterior chaetigers. Dorsal and ventral cirri present; small, conical; prominent from chaetiger 16. Interramal papillae small, in anterior chaetigers, becoming larger in middle and posterior parapodia.</p>
<p>All chaetigers with noto- and neuropodial fascicles of slender capillaries; in anterior region arranged into 2 rows, with chaetae of posterior row longest; capillaries of middle and posterior chaetigers arranged in 1 row. Lyrate chaetae present from chaetiger 2; tine very long, unequal, both tapering to very slender filamentous tip.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong>. The combination of the following characters – arenicoliform body shape, T-shaped prostomium, presence of dorsal and ventral cirri in posterior segments, absence of spines and absence of branchiae make this species consistent with genus <em>Pseudoscalibregma </em>(see Blake, 1981).</p>
<p>This genus is well represented in the region, with four species known: <em>Pseudoscalibregma bransfieldium</em> (Hartman, 1967); <em>Pseudoscalibregma usarpium</em> Blake, 1981; <em>Pseudoscalibregma papilia</em> Schüller, 2008 and <em>Pseudoscalibregma palmeri</em> Blake, 2015. Falkland Island specimen differs from these and likely represents a news species (see comparative table below).</p>

<p><strong><em>Asclerocheilus sp. 1</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher: </strong>SEA LION: station 19MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.  </strong>A small-sized species, body elongate, arenicoliform, expanded in anterior half then tapering in abdominal region; voucher specimen incomplete with 27 chaetigers, fragment  5mm long and 0.5mm wide at its widest. Colour in alcohol tanned. Body segments triannulate; annulations formed of small squared cells; annulation distinct. Pygidium missing.</p>
<p>Prostomium small, with prominent rounded anterolateral horns giving it overall heart-shaped appearance; posterior margin of prostomium visible dorsally; eyes absent. Peristomium achaetous, not concealing posterior margin of prostomium, consisting of single ring complete dorsally.</p>
<p>Branchiae absent. Parapodia biramous, reduced, inconspicuous throughout. Dorsal and ventral cirri not developed.</p>
<p>All chaetigers with noto- and neuropodial fascicles of slender capillaries. Chaetiger 1 and 2 with a row of about 10 large, heavy, slightly curved spines, with long filamentous tips. Lyrate chaetae present from chaetiger 2; tines unequal, the longer tine with long slender filamentous tip with distinct subdistal kink.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong>. The combination of the following characters – arenicoliform body shape, shape of prostomium, presence of large spines, absence of branchiae and absence of dorsal and ventral cirri make this specimen consistent with genus <em>Asclerocheilus </em>(see Blake, 1981). This genus is represented in the region by only two known species <em>Asclerocheilus capensis </em>Day, 1963 and<em> A. ashworthi </em>Blake, 1981. Falkland Island specimen differs from this species in having distinct rounded prostomial lobes. Such lobes are also present in South African species <em>A. capensis</em>, but Falkland specimen differs in having a heart-shaped prostomium (posteriorly narrower than anteriorly) and lyrate chaetae possess a distinct subdistal kink of the longer tine. Falkland Islands specimen likely represents a new species.</p>

<p><strong><em>Spiochaetopterus</em></strong><strong> sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. LOLIGO: station 3FA and INFLEXIBLE: station 3MFB.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The morphological description of chaetopterids is structured in 3 different body regions following Bhaud (1998): anterior (region A), mid-body (region B) and posterior (region C) (e.g.  A4 = chaetiger 4 in region A, B1= chaetiger 1 in region B).</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Small-sized species, specimen with well preserved region A, but damaged region B and C (specimens incomplete), annoculate species with the following count of chaetigers: 9A, 2B and at least 5C (specimens incomplete); measuring 4mm long and 0.3mm wide for 16 chaetigers. Eyes absent. Chaetiger A4 with a single large modified spine, spine rhomboid (?) in distal view, amber coloured. Long and short lanceolate chaetae present in region A. Red/brown band ventrally on A6 and very distinct white band on A7. Structure of region B and C not clearly observed due to damage of the specimen. Tube unbranched, smooth (no articulations) and translucent.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Two species previously reported from the region are  <em>Spiochaetopterus patagonicus</em> Kinberg, 1866, (no description available at the time of writing) and <em>S. costarum</em> (see Hartmann-Schroder, 1991), which differs from FI specimen in having much larger number of mid-body (region B) segments (29 reported by Hartman-Shroder, 1991) and articulated tube.  Bhaud (1998) eastablished  two groups of <em>Spiochaetopterus</em>, based on comparison of five species of the genus <em>Spiochaetopterus: S. typicus, S. bergensis, S. costarum, S. oculatus</em>, and <em>S. solitarius</em>. Group A, with boreal biogeographic affinity, consisting of <em>S. typicus</em> and <em>S. bergensis</em>. Representatives of group A have a middle region of two segments, modified setae of segment A4 are distally rhomboid and the tubes are without articulations. Group B, with temperate biogeographic affinity, consisting of <em>S. costarum</em>, <em>S. solitarius</em> and <em>S. oculatus</em>. Representatives of group B have a middle region of many, always more than 2 segments; modified setae of A4 are distally cordate, and the tubes are with articulations. Falkland Island specimens clearly belongs to group A, which species have boreal distribution. It is therefore likely that Falkland Islands specimens represent a new species, but better preserved material will be necessary to compare and diagnose this species. For now, we suggest morphospecies name <em>Spiochaetopterus</em> sp. 1.</p>

<p><strong>Vouchers. </strong>VINSON WEST: station 1MFA and INFLEXIBLE: station 2MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The morphological description of chaetopterids is structured in 3 different body regions following Bhaud (1998): anterior (region A), mid-body (region B) and posterior (region C) (e.g.  A4 = chaegier 4 in region A, B1= chaetiger 1 in region B) .</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Small sized species, all specimens incomplete, measuring 5mm long and 0.75-1mm wide for 20 chaetigers. Body regions with the following number of chaetigers:  9A, 2B and at least 9C (specimen incomplete) with C1-C4 inflated. Eyes absent. Chaetiger A1 with short dorsal, short, wide, “lobes”, far apart, situated lateral to the palps. Chaetiger A4 with about 6 stout modified spines in a single row, decreasing in size ventrally; each spine amber coloured; cup shaped (distally expanded), with several (about 8) teeth on both lateral edges. Region A also with lanceolate chaetae.</p>
<p>Glandular ventral shield as a white band on ventral side of A4. Region B with two chaetigers; B notopodia foliaceous, bilobed; B neuropodia each with single band of uncini. Region C with notopodia, elongated, slender, with two long slender, subdistally lanceolate protruding chaetae; C neuropodia bilobed, with uncini. Mid to posterior C region and pygidium missing. Tube not observed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Based on comparative table of the known <em>Phyllochaetopterus</em> species (see Nishi and Rouse, 2007), the Falkland Island specimens belong to group C: species with several (6 or more) spines in chaetiger A4, 9 chaetigers in region A and only 2 chaetigers in region B.  Currently, there are four other species in this group, all from tropical regions: <em>P. aciculigerus </em>Crossland, 1904 from Maldives, <em>P. herdmani</em> (Hornell in Willey, 1905) from Sri Lanka,  <em>P. verrilli</em> Treadwell, 1943 from Hawaii (<em>P. verrilli</em> is considered a synonym of  <em>P. brevitentaculata </em>from Palmyra Atoll, Pacific Ocean). Given the differences in distribution, Falkland Island specimens likely represent a new species, but comparison with type material will be needed to confirm this.  Falkland Island specimens also differ from the only known species from the region <em>Phyllochaetopterus monroi</em> Hartman, 1967 (type locality Strait of Magellan), which belongs to group A (Nishi and Rouse, 2007) as it possesses 9 chaetigers in region A, 2 chaetigers in region B, but only 1 large spine in chaetiger A4. Falkland Island specimens likely represent a new species, but better preserved material may be needed to fully diagnose this species, until such time it is assigned here to morphospecies <em>Phyllochaetopterus </em>sp. 1.</p>

<p>Two species of Chaetopteridae were collected from Falkland Islands, one belongs to genus  <em>Phyllochaetopterus</em> Grube, 1863 and the other to <em>Spiochaetopterus</em> M Sars, 1856. Both species are likely new to science, suggesting that diversity of this group is greater than two known species reported from the wider region so far <em>Chaetopterus variopedatus </em>(Renier, 1804); <em>Spiochaetopterus patagonicus</em> Kinberg, 1866, <em>S. costarum</em> Hartman-Schroder, 1991 and <em>Phyllochaetopterus monroi</em> Hartman, 1967).  Further, the <em>Chaetopterus variopedatus </em>was originally described from the Mediterranean Sea and it is possible that Southern Ocean specimens belong to other as yet undescribed species. The morphological description of chaetopterids is structured in 3 different body regions following Bhaud (1998): anterior (region A), mid-body (region B) and posterior (region C) (e.g.  A4 = chaetiger 4 in region A, B1= chaetiger 1 in region B).</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong>  Voucher is a small, incomplete specimen, fragment about 4.5mm long and 0.4mm wide for 16 chaetigers; first 6 chaetigers with notochaetae only; from chaetiger 7 hooded hooks only.

<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>The combination of characters such as 6 chaetigers with notochaetae only (hooks only present from chaetiger 7) and 12 thoracic segments is consistent with genus <em>Neomediomastus</em> Hartman, 1969. Similar genus <em>Barantolla</em> Southern, 1921 has only 11 thoracic segments. Currently, only two species in the genus <em>Neomediomastus</em> are known: <em>N glabrus</em> (Hartman, 1960) described from Southern California and <em>N. leptus</em> Green, 2002 from Thailand. It is likely that Falkland Islands specimens represent a new species, but better preserved specimens will be necessary to fully diagnose this species. Care should be taken not to confuse these with <em>Notomastus</em>, which has a similar body shape and appearance, but has 11 chaetigers with notochaetae only.</p>

<p><strong><em>Capitella</em> sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>SEA LION: station 2MFA</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong>  Small-sized, slender species; voucher is a small, incomplete specimen, fragment about 2.7mm long and 0.25mm wide (at the widest part of thorax) for about 14 chaetigers; first 4 chaetigers with notochaetae only; from chaetiger 5 hooded hooks only; genital spines not observed. Body cylindrical, widest across chaetiger 5-6 (forming a “bump” effect) tapering in chaetigers 7-9; abdomen abruptly narrowing, slender. Segments in thorax short. Segments in abdomen elongated, with 3 annuli per segment, each annulus about as long as wide. Colour in alcohol tan. Prostomium broad, bluntly rounded on anterior margin, as wide as long, thick, flattened.  Peristomium simple incomplete achaetigerous ring, prominent dorsally and laterally, merging into oral opening ventrally, becoming roof of mouth; eyes absent.</p>
<p>Chaetigers 1-4 with notochaetae only in both rami; notochaetae capillaries, unilimbate with narrow wings.  From chaetiger 5 multidentate hooded hooks only in both rami; hooks with at least 3 rows of denticles above main fang observed in profile with wide gap between the main fang and first small denticle above it; about 6 hooks per ramus. Abdomen damaged, pygidium unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>At least 3 species of <em>Capitella</em> were encountered in Falkland Island material. These are here distinguished by the body shape and form of multidentate hooks (see comparative table below). Assigning those specimens to any previously reported species from the region will be difficult as great variation can be encountered in a single species (see Blake, 2009 for re-description of <em>Capitella capitata</em>).  Molecular studies will be needed to help resolve the status of <em>Capitella</em> species in Falkland material and here will be assigned to morphospecies only.</p>

<p><strong><em>Scalibregma</em> sp. 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher: </strong>TOROA: station T5FB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong> A medium sized species, body elongate, arenicoliform, expanded in anterior half then tapering to narrow abdominal region; voucher specimen incomplete, 9mm long and 1mm wide at its widest part for 22 chaetigers. Colour light yellow, without orange cast (common in other <em>Scalibregma</em> species); without pigmentation; upon staining, Shirla stain retained ventrally to neuropodia of chaetiger 4 as a patch of pink to reddish dots; similar staining retained in dorsal and ventral cirri of narrow abdominal region.</p>
<p>Body surface with the annulation formed by rows of quadrate cells, these moderately developed, rather faint; cells rectangular and very narrow (much longer than wide); segments tri- to quadriannulate. Ventral midline from chaetiger 2 with group of four large epidermal pads per segment in anterior segments merging into a single pad in middle and posterior segments, forming ridge line within mid-ventral groove; mid-ventral groove and ridge line continuing posteriorly.</p>
<p>Prostomium anteriorly somewhat dome shaped with distinct lateral processes or horns; posterior margin of prostomium visible dorsally; eyes absent. Peristomium achaetous, not concealing posterior margin of prostomium; without distinct segmentation, integument best described as wrinkled, particularly ventrally. Mouth with a row of about 10 narrow lobes forming upper lip, lower lip at level of chaetiger 1, integument wrinkled without obvious lobes .</p>
<p>Arborescent (=dendritically) branched branchiae present on chaetigers 2‒5 posterior to notochaetae. Parapodia biramous, reduced, inconspicuous anteriorly becoming larger and more conspicuous in middle and posterior chaetigers. Dorsal and ventral cirri develop from about chaetiger 11<strong>; </strong>dorsal cirri round to oval, somewhat inflated, ventral cirri similar; without pigmentation, with yellowish glands present (these turn pink to reddish upon staining with Shirla-stain). Interramal papillae small, in anterior chaetigers, becoming larger by mid body.</p>
<p>All chaetigers with noto- and neuropodial fascicles of slender capillaries; in anterior region arranged into 2 rows, with chaetae of posterior row longest; capillaries of middle and posterior chaetigers arranged in 1‒2 rows.  Chaetiger 1 with additional anterior row of very short, slender chaetae, at least 6 observed in the voucher specimen; these include pointed aristate spinous chaetae, some subdistally slightly enlarged; few appear to be furcate, tips likely broken off; further clarifications with the help of SEM may be needed. Lyrate chaetae present from chaetiger 2; each lyrate chaetae with distinctly unequal tines with the longer tine tapering to very slender filamentous tip. Pygidium uknown.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong>. The cosmopolitan status of <em>Scalibregma inflatum </em>(Ashworth, 1902) from Northern Europe  has been questioned and upon careful examination, similar, but distinct species were recently discovered (e.g. Mackie, 1991; Blake, 2000; Baken et al., 2014). Upon revision of Southern Ocean material, a new species <em>Scalibragma australis</em> has been described by Blake (2015). Falkland Islands collection also revealed a diversity of <em>Scalibregma</em> species, with at least 3 species new to science present. <em>Scalibregma</em> sp. 2 differs from the known species as well as from <em>Scalibregma</em> sp. 1 and <em>Scalibregma</em> sp. 3. These differences are summarised in table below, with the conspicuous shape of prostomium being an easy to observe character. Additional observation with the help of SEM will be necessary to fully diagnose this species.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher: </strong>VINSON WEST: station 1MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong> A small sized species, body elongate, anterior part slightly expanded, gradually tapering posteriorly; voucher specimen incomplete, with 14 chaetigers, 2mm long and 0.5mm wide. Colour light yellow, without pigmentation; without staining pattern (using Shirla-stain).</p>
<p>Body surface with the annulation formed by rows of quadrate cells, these moderately developed, more or less quadrate; segments tri- to quadriannulate. Ventral midline from chaetiger 2 with epidermal pads present until the end of fragment. Prostomium with very elongated processes or horns; positioned anteriorly giving the prostomium V-shaped appearance; posterior margin of prostomium visible dorsally; eyes absent. Proboscis partially everted, concealing the nature of peristomium and anteriormost segments ventrally.</p>
<p>Arborescent (=dendritically) branched branchiae present on chaetigers 2‒5 posterior to notochaetae. Parapodia biramous, reduced, inconspicuous in 14 chaetigers. Dorsal and ventral cirri not developed on 14 chaetigers present; uknown in posterior chaetigers.</p>
<p>All chaetigers with noto- and neuropodial fascicles of slender capillaries; in anterior region arranged into 2 rows, with chaetae of posterior row longest; capillaries of middle and posterior chaetigers arranged in 1‒2 rows. Lyrate chaetae present from chaetiger 2; each lyrate chaeta with unequal tynes with the longer tyne tapering to very slender filamentous tip; bristles on inner margins very short. Abdomen and pygidium uknown.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong>. The lack of midposterior and posterior segments due to incompleteness of the specimens prevents conclusive generic assignment of this specimen (the development of dorsal and ventral cirri in those segments is an important taxonomic character). Given the small size of the specimen, we cannot exclude that it may be juvenile.

<p><strong><em>Travisia </em>sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>TOROA: station T4FB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Small, complete specimen; body inflated, compact (=”grub-shaped”), thickest at middle and tapering to both ends; 3 mm long and 1 mm for 17 chaetigers. Body whitish to pale yellow. Integument rugose; ventrally segments crowded; dorsally each segment with 3 rows of reticulated pattern, composed of rectangularish (much wider than long) cells. Prostomium sharply conical, much longer than wide; eyes absent. All chaetigers biramous; without obvious parapodia. First chaetiger with chaetal fascicles shifted dorsally; chaetal  fascicles well separated in all chaetigers. Branchiae absent. Two achaetous, pre-anal segments. Anal cylinder abrupt after last parapodial segment, very small and short, composed terminally of 4-5 short, rounded lobes.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong>. This is a small, featureless specimen that does not appear to fit any known species in this genus as it is very small in size, possesses low number of segments and lacks characters such as branchiae, distinct parapodial lobe or obvious nephridiophores. The lack of branchiae align this species with abranchiate species previously assigned to genus<em> Kesun</em> Chamberlin, 1919<em>, </em>which has been synonymised with <em>Travisia</em> by Dauvin and Bellan (1994). Falkland Island specimen is here assigned to morphospecies <em>Travisia </em>sp. 1.</p>

<p>Taxonomic status of this group is in flux.  Travisiidae were originally created as a subfamily of Opheliidae by Hartmann-Schröder, 1971, but subsequently shown to be a sister group to Scalibregmatidae from molecular studies (Paul et al., 2010). The notes in WORMS database suggest that recently this group has been raised in rank to a separate family by Blake and Maciolek (2016: online, unpublished nomenclaturally), which we follow here. Genus <em>Travisia</em> Johnston, 1840 is well represented in waters from the region (particularly from deeper waters) by 10 species: <em>Travisia glandulosa</em> McIntosh, 1879,  <em>Travisia kerguelensis </em>McIntosh, 1885, <em>Travisia chiloensis</em> Kükenthal, 1887, <em>Travisia olens</em> Ehlers, 1897, <em>Travisia nigrocincta</em> Ehlers, 1913, <em>Travisia profundi</em> Chamberlin, 1919, <em>Travisia antarctica</em> Hartman, 1967, <em>Travisia amadoi</em> Elías, Bremec, Lana and Orensanz, 2003, <em>Travisia monroi</em> Maciolek & Blake, 2006, <em>Travisia palmeri</em> Maciolek and Blake, 2006, <em>Travisia tincta</em> Maciolek and Blake, 2006.</p>

<p>Terebellidae have confused taxonomic history with the on-going debate (Nogueira, Fitzhugh & Hutchings, 2013). This is another group from the region in urgent need of revision and update of taxonomic literature. The species overview is here organised by subfamily. Briefly the subfamilies as recognised here can be identified as follows (modified from Jirkov and Leontovich, 2013; see also other references below for terminology, characters and alternative classifications):</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Terebellinae:</strong> upper lip usually small; branchiae present or absent, if present of various shapes, usually branched; thoracic uncini arranged in double rows in posterior thorax.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Thelepodinae: </strong>upper lip usually small; branchiae always present, as simple filaments and never branched; thoracic uncini arranged in single row.</p>

Voucher specimen 17mm long and 3mm wide for about 16 thoracic chaetigers and about 5 abdominal uncinigers (posteriorly incomplete); body light yellow in alcohol, without pigmentation. Eyes absent. Segmental lobes not particularly enlarged, but present; segment 1 and 2 similar, low ventrally, with moderately enlarged ventrolaterally lobes; segment 3 also low ventrally, with small lateral lobes.</p>
<p>Branchiae present; 3 pairs on segment 1-3, these are likely damaged as only stumps observed.</p>
<p>Thorax with 16 chaetigers. Notochaetae from segment 3; relatively numerous, arranged in two rows, long and short, both narrowly bilimbate throughout the length of the shaft. Thoracic uncini present from chaetiger 2 (=segment 4), first 6 uncinigers with uncini in a single row, arranged in double (alternating) row from unciniger 7, until the end of the fragment. Thoracic uncini avicular, with rostrate tooth (see images for details). Abdomen unknown. Pygidium unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Generic assignment of these specimens is problematic. Presence of uncini arranged in double row, presence of branchiae and form uncini is consistent with subfamily Terebellinae. However as branchiae are likely damaged (only single stumps are present), it is difficult to assign generic ID. The specimens are therefore assigned to morphospecies Terebellinae sp. 1 until better preserved material becomes available.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong> Voucher specimen reasonably well preserved if incomplete; 6.5mm long, 0.8 mm wide for 13 thoracic chaetigers and 6 abdominal uncinigers (posteriorly incomplete); dark yellow to light orange in colour. Dorsum anteriorly tessellated; anterior end with 4-5 inflated, rounded structures (probably damage?).

<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> <em>Polycirrus</em> sp. 1 agrees in some respects with <em>P. hesslei</em> Monro, 1930 described from Falkland Islands. They share 13 thoracic segments with notochaetae and uncini present from 1<sup>st</sup> abdominal unciniger (=uncini absent on segments with notochaetae). Monro’s type is housed at NHM London and was also checked (see also re-description by Glasby and Hutchings, 2013), however the much larger size of the holotype compared to Falklands Island specimens complicates a meaningful comparison. However, the upper lip of Falklands Island specimen appears to be comprised of single lobe with convoluted rather than trefoiled as in <em>P. hesslei</em> and dorsum of anterior end is tessellated rather than smooth. This is probably a new species, but further work is needed to provide a full description of this species. Genus <em>Polycirrus</em> has been recently revised by Glasby and Hutchings (2013).</p>

<p><strong><em>Lysilla </em></strong><strong>sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>HERO: station 1MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Voucher a single specimen, small, nearly severed into two pieces, with posterior part stretched and damaged; about 7mm long, thorax 0.9mm wide (at widest, “swollen” part). Upper lip projected forward as a large, convoluted lobe. Dorsum and venter anteriorly tessellated to rugose. Nephridial papillae not observed (even upon staining with Shirla stain). Six pairs of very slender, elongated, but distally enlarged notopodia present (presumably on segments 3-8).  Notochaetae few, all very short, smooth, thin. The rest of body damaged.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>The only known species from the region <em>Lysilla macintoshi</em> Gravier, 1907 has been described from shallow depths (25-40m) holotype was 14mm long, 3mm wide, brown-yellow with 6 segments with notochaetae, large genital papillae on segments 6-8 and very long, subdistally spatulate notochaetae (see image below). Of the 14 described species of <em>Lysilla</em>, only two other species have notopodia terminating on segment 10 or before. <em>Lysilla loveni </em>Malmgren, 1866, originally described from Sweden with 6-8 pairs of notopodia extending until segments 8–10, with winged notochaetae in both rows. <em>Lysilla longilinea </em>Nogueira, Hutchings and Carrerette, 2015 from Lizard Island, Australia has only five pairs of notopodia (on segments 3–7) and its thorax is not swollen. Although Falkland Island specimen is not in the best condition, the comparison here suggests it represents a new species. However a well preserved specimen is needed to provide a formal description and to corroborate the preliminary conclusion reached here.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>VINSON WEST: station 1MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Voucher specimen very small and slender, complete, about 4mm long and 0.4mm wide for about 33 chaetigers. Body anteriorly somewhat dorsoventrally flattened. Segmental lobes absent. Branchiae absent. Eyes absent. Abdomen with about 22 uncinigers. Pygidium rounded lobe.</p>
<p>Eleven thoracic chaetigers. Notochaetae of 2 types – long, broadly bi-limbate and short lanceolate. Thoracic uncini present from chaetiger 2, first 6 uncinigers with uncini in a single row, from unciniger 7 arranged in double (alternating) row, until the end of the fragment.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Generic assignment of these specimens is somewhat problematic as taxonomy of abranchiate terebellids lacks consistent characters. The combination of the following characters: absence of branchiae, presence of uncini from chaetiger 2 and presence of lanceolate notochaetae shows affinities with genus <em>Leaena</em> Malmgren, 1866. Genus <em>Leaena</em> appears to be well represented in the region. Number of thoracic chaetigers varies from 10-17 in different species. Further work would be necessary to establish if Falkland Island species represents a new species and name <em>Leaena</em> sp. 2 is assigned here provisionally.</p>

Branchiae absent. Eyes absent. Abdomen unknown. Pygidium unknown.</p>
<p>At least 16 thoracic chaetigers with notochaetae. Notochaetae of 2 types – long, slender, narrowly bi-limbate and short lanceolate (those are missing on the last 3 thoracic chaetigers).

<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Generic assignment of these specimens is somewhat problematic as taxonomy of abranchiate terebellids lacks consistent characters. The combination of the following characters: absence of branchiae, presence of uncini from chaetiger 2 and presence of lanceolate notochaetae shows affinities with genus <em>Leaena</em> Malmgren, 1866. Abranchiate genus <em>Pseudoproclea</em> Hutchings and Glasby, 1990 with only one known species from Australia also similar, but lanceolate chaetae are not present. Genus <em>Leaena</em> appears to be well represented in the region. Number of thoracic chaetigers varies from 10-17 in those species. As specimens collected from Falkland Islands are incomplete and posterior part of thorax is damaged (stretched) it is difficult to establish the number of thoracic chaetiger with certainty and compare characters derived from the abdomen. The specimens are therefore assigned to morphospecies <em>Leaena</em> sp. 1 until better preserved material becomes available.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hauchiella </em></strong><strong>sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher.</strong> VINSON WEST: station 1MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Voucher specimen is a single, incomplete and damaged specimen; relatively robust, fragment about 7mm long and about 1.8mm wide; anterior part of the body is more robust, then tapering; number of segments not established. All tentacles missing. Large, convoluted upper lip is much wider than long. Thoracic segments strongly annulated, narrow and tessellated.  Genital papillae not confirmed (damage to the tissue covers a large part of thorax).</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> Given the complete lack of chaetae, there are very few characters available to distinguish between species of <em>Hauchiella</em>. For a long time, only the type species of the genus <em>Hauchiella tribullata</em> (McIntosh, 1869) described from St Magnus Bay, Shetlands, Scotland, from 165 m was known and reported widely, including reports from the Southern Ocean. The holotype of this species was reported by Nogueira et al. (2015) to be large and robust (about 20mm long, up to 2mm wide), with very few buccal tentacles remaining (all uniformly cylindrical), with a large, convoluted upper lip of width greater than length, and large, rounded nephridial papillae on segments 6–8. <em>Hauchiella renilla</em> Hutchings and Glasby, 1986 was described as a second species in this genus more than 100 year later and distinguished from <em>H. tribullata</em> by its smaller size and absence of genital papillae<strong>.</strong> Only very recently a third species <em>Hauchiella tentaculata</em> Nogueira, Hutchings and Carrerette, 2015 was added and distinguished form the other two species by modified long tentacles and inconspicuous or absent nephridia  (=not visible through the body wall). It is, therefore, likely that Falkland Island specimen represent a new species, but well preserved material will be necessary to formally describe this species.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>INFLEXIBLE: station 5MFB and 4MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Small, slender species; both specimens are incomplete, with only 10 and 16 thoracic chaetigers respectively (thorax incomplete); the larger specimen 9mm long and 1mm wide with 16 chaetigers. Characteristic proboscis conical, densely and irregularly covered by small papillae; papillae globular at the base of proboscis, longer conical at the distal end of the proboscis. Peristomium dorsally with 3 large, convoluted lobes, their margins densely covered by very short ovoid tentacles. Eye spots or pigmentation absent. Branchiae present; 3 pairs on segments 2- 4; each branchial tuft composed of few (<10) simple filaments of unequal lengths arising from basal stump. Large ephridiophore conspicuous as a large opening on segment 3; not observed on subsequent segments. Notopodia from 3<sup>rd</sup> branchial segment (=segment 4), total number unknown (specimens incomplete). Notochaetae few, with short and long group, each chaetae broadly bilimbate, distally extending into long slender tip.  Uncini present from chaetiger 2 (=segment 5; = 1<sup>st</sup> unciniger); arranged in single row in first 6 uncinigers, then from unciniger 7 in double rows; uncini avicular. The rest of body uknown.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Of currently 9 known <em>Artacama</em> species, 3 have been described from the region. <em>Artacama challengeriae</em> McIntosh, 1885 from Kerguelen Islands, <em>Artacama crassa</em> Hartman, 1967 from Bransfield Straits and <em>Artacama valparaisiensis</em> Rozbaczylo and Mendez, 1996 from Valparaiso Bay, Chile. Of these, the last species can be distinguished by notochaetae with constrictions and all three species differ by having a large rounded proboscis with regular row of papillae rather than conical proboscis without regular pattern. However all three species are represented by large specimen, so the size difference may compound the comparison. Given the incompleteness of Falkland Islands material, the specimens are currently assigned to morphospecies <em>Artacama</em> sp. 1.</p>

<p><strong><em>Amphitritides</em></strong><strong> sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>SEA LION: station 40MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Voucher specimen is a large, robust, complete specimen; about 85mm long and 5mm wide, with 16 thoracic chaetigers with notochaetae and numerous (>200 abdominal uncinigers).</p>
<p>Distal part of prostomium forming conspicuous shelf-like process from which buccal tentacles originate (tentacles mostly missing); basal part of prostomium without eyespots. Peristomium forming lips and continuing laterally from mouth for short extension; upper lip short, hood-like, lower lip narrow.</p>
<p>Segment 1 short, most developed ventrally and ventrolaterally, forming protruding ventral lobe below lower lip. Segments 2–4 with anterior margins thickened, but without lobes. Branchiae present; two pairs on segments 2-3 (left branchia on segment 2 missing); second pair aligned slightly laterally to first pair; first pair about twice as large as the second ones (both shorter than body width); both dichotomously branching with short ramifications; each with short and thick main stem. Nephridial papillae present segments 3 and 6-8; inserted laterally to branchial stem on segment 3 and anteriorly to base of notopodia and aligned to them on segments 6-8.</p>
<p>Notopodia from segment 4, present on 16 segments. Notochaetae arranged in two rows with those in anterior row shorter; notochaetae smooth, subdistally with bi-limbate inflation, inflation expanded basally; distally extending into slender tip. Neuropodia beginning on chaetiger 2 (segment 5), as low rectangular ridges slightly raised from the surface of the body throughout, without internal supporting rods. Uncini short handled, with conspicuous dorsal button, short triangular heel and prow distally pointed and downwardly directed; uncini in double rows, from thoracic unciniger 7 (segment 11) until posterior body (including many abdominal segments, but about posteriormost 1/3 of the body with uncini in single rows again).</p>
<p>Pygidium slightly damaged, not clearly observed. Tube: fine, smooth, muddy; patches of thin sand encrustation on the body observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.  </strong>Falkland Island specimen agrees well with genus <em>Amphitritides</em> in having two pairs of small, dichotomously branching branchiae, much shorter than body width, neuropodia as low ridges along whole body, with uncini arranged in double rows from the 7th uncinigerous segment until posterior segments, where in single rows again. Similar genera <em>Neoleprea</em> Hessle, 1917 and <em>Tyira</em> Hutchings, 1997 can be distinguished in that notopodia begin on segment 2 in <em>Tyira</em>, segment 3 in <em>Neoleprea</em> while it is segment 4 in <em>Amphitritides</em> (Nogueira and Hutchings, 2007). The species in genus <em>Amphitritides </em>can be distinguished from each other mainly by the number of pairs of notopodia, morphology of notochaetae and uncini, segments with nephridial papillae and their position. Combination of these characters suggests that Falkland Island specimen represent a new species and should be formally described. The comparison of Falkland Island specimen and six known species of <em>Amphitritides</em> is provided in the table below (see also Nogueira and Hutchings, 2007 for more details).</p>

<p><strong>Voucher specimen.</strong> SEALION: stations 1MFC and 8MFA; TOROA: station T4FA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Fragmented specimen from 8 MFA 40 mm with 100 chaetigers. First two to three chaetigers slightly enlarged but not projecting forward. Ceratophores of the antennae are long with at least 10 rings. Peristomium complete, not incised mid-dorsally. Peristomial cirri long, as long as peristomium and inserted distally.</p>

<p>Anterior pseudo-compound hooks tridentate with truncated hoods; palmate chaetae flat; subacicular hooks bidentate, starting on chaetigers 12–15.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> The body of this species has an iridescent sheen and in fresh material there is a pigment spot at the base of the anterior chaetigers. Orensanz (1990) notes that the ventral cirri of this species are cirriform over the anterior 4 to 5 chaetigers. The species was one of the commonest in the Sealion samples and it appears to be a widespread species in the Magellanic region occurring at depths of 21–861 m.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Small worm, 5 mm fragment with 21 chaetigers. Chaetiger 1 enlarged and facing forwards. Five pairs of antennae with the median one longest, ceratostyles with three obvious rings and then an elongated plain area before the junction with the ceratophore in the three median antennae.

<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> This species resembles the description and diagrams give by Orensanz (1990), but there are differences. The head is not small and narrow compared to following segments, the form of the parapodia of chaetiger 1 is less robust, the form of the hooks on chaetiger 1 are finer with less obvious bidentate endings and the start position of the subacicular hooks is on chaetiger 6 not chaetiger 4 as described by Orensanz (1990). The main difficulty in providing an authoritative identification is because of the great disparity in size between the type specimens of <em>Anchinothria pycnobranchata</em> and the FI specimens, which are much smaller. Some of the differences outlined may be related to size and require a range of specimen sizes for study before a definitive identification can be given.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong>  Voucher small sand slender, but complete specimen; 15mm long and 0.4mm wide for 17 chaetigers and 3 pre-anal rings; chaetigers 1-7 relatively short (about twice as long as wide), from chaetiger 8 segments very long (about 4 times as long as wide), with the two posteriormost chaetigers short again;  first pre-anal ring short (resembling preceding chaetiger), the second and third anal rings very short, crowded. Preserved specimen pale yellow in colour.              </p>
<p>Prostomium with well-developed cephalic plaque; cephalic rim very low, without notches (with the exception of two shallow “dips” near mid-anterior peak), palpode not developed; low rising cephalic keel present throughout the length of cephalic plaque, bordered by straight, slightly divergent nuchal organs; no ocelli.</p>
<p>First chaetiger with both noto- and neurochaetae. Neuropodia of chaetigers 1 -3 with single rotsrate hook (dentition of these uncini well-developed); in subsequent chaetigers up to 7 rostrate uncini arranged in a single row; with several thin fibrils (barbells) underneath the main fang; with manubrial constriction on its shaft.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>This species has been ascribed to genus <em>Axiothella</em> based on the combination of the following characters: well developed cephalic and anal plaques, symmetrical anal plaque border by cirri of (mostly) equal size, neurochaetae of chaetigers 1-3 as a single rostrate hooks, reduced in number compared to subsequent segment and anus protruding from anal plaque.  Revision of Maldanidae from the region is needed and currently we ascribe Falkland Islands’ specimens to <em>Axiothella </em>sp. 1</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis.  </strong>Voucher is small, fragile incomplete specimen, 3.5mm long and 0.3mm wide (including parapodia) for 35 segments; colour in alcohol yellow, with irregular pigmentation on prostomium and body, with dorsal cirri more strongly pigmented, ventral cirri with lighter pigmentation.</p>
<p>Prostomium trapezoid, widest posteriorly, slightly longer than wide; with 5 prostomial appendages of similar form, short and cirriform: medina antenna, inserted anteriorly; pair of antennae and pair of palps; eyes absent; nuchal papilla not observed. Proboscis not observed.</p>
<p>Four pairs of tentacular cirri; cirri of segment 1, dorsal and ventral cirri of segment 2, and dorsal cirri of segment 3 (segment 3 also with ventral cirrus similar to those of subsequent segments); cirri of segment 1 and dorsal cirri of segment 2 similar – approaching bottle-shaped form, with enlarged base and extended tips, of similar length; dorsal cirri of segment 3 longest (reaching to about segment 6), cirriform, tapering; ventral cirri of segment 2 of different form – flattened, broad and oval. Segment 1 not reduced dorsally.</p>
<p>Parapodia uniramous; neuropodial lobes symmetrical. Dorsal cirri rather long, narrow, flattened with slightly expanded rounded end – paddle-shaped; similar throughout the fragment, distinctly pigmented. Ventral cirri shorter than dorsal cirri, oval, tapering.</p>
<p>Chaetae observed from chaetiger 4; only about 7 per fascicle; all compound spinigers with slender blades, tapering into thin tips; rostrum of chaetal shaft of two types – tridentate, with similar large teeth and those with single large tooth and 3 pairs of smaller teeth on each side. Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.  </strong>The generic placement of this specimen is somewhat problematic as it shows similarities to genus <em>Pterocirrus</em> (mostly due to anterior position of median antenna), but also show similarities to genus <em>Eulalia</em>. This specimen resembles <em>Eulalia microoculata </em>from Northern Europe, which itself shows a combination of characters from both genera. Falkland Island specimen differs in lacking eyes (small eyes are present in<em> E. microoculata</em>), having trapezoid rather than rounded prostomium, bottle-shaped form of some tentacular cirri and while dorsal cirri are also flattened and vey elongated, they do not appear to have paddle-shaped form with expanded tips in <em>E. microoculata</em>.</p>

<p>Prostomium almost rounded; eyes absent; with 2 pairs of prostomial appendages: pair of antenna and pair of cirriform palps, of similar form, long (reaching almost to segment 1) and cirriform; median antenna not observed (see remarks). Proboscis not observed. Tentacular cirri missing, but scars clearly observed confirming presence of 4 pairs in 1+2+1 arrangement. Segment 1 not reduced dorsally.</p>
<p>Dorsal cirri all missing. Ventral cirri mostly missing, those present ovate, with small blotches of brown pigment. Chaetigerous lobes, assymetrical, with slightly (but distinctly) longer digiform in upper part; with about 10 chaetae.

<p><strong>Remarks.  </strong>The specimens are in imperfect condition, but clearly represent a distinct species from other phyllodocid material encountered in Falkland Islands collection. Generic identification is based on asymmetrical chaetigerous lobes, which is a hallmark of genus <em>Sige </em>Malmgren, 1865, but also occurs in closely related genus <em>Pterocirrus </em>Claparède, 1868 (see Pleijel, 1990; 1993). The two genera are further distinguished based on the insertion of median antenna – medially in <em>Sige, </em>but anteriorly in <em>Pterocirrus</em> as well as the form of proboscis, which was not observed in Falkland Island material. The median antenna was not observed in either of the Falkland specimens and even upon staining of the specimens, the presence of its scar is difficult to observe, possibly placed anteriorly. Better specimens will be needed to fully diagnose this species and confirm the generic identification.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> This specimen is in a good condition, although pygidium is missing and proboscis is not everted (as this is the only example of this species collected, proboscis was not dissected) and those characters are needed to confirm the generic identity (see Wilson, 1988 for details on genera, <em>Eteone</em>, <em>Hypereteone</em> and <em>Mysta</em>). Of those genera only two species are known from the region. <em>Eteone sculpta </em>Ehlers, 1897 and  <em>Eteone aurantiaca</em> Schmarda, 1861 (<em>Eteone spathocephala</em> Ehlers, 1897  with type locality Falkland Islands is considered a junior synonym of this species). Based on images provided by Ehlers (1897), the Falkland Island specimens agree well with <em>E. spathocephala</em> (now accepted as <em>E. aurantiaca</em>) in shape of prostomium, although anal cirri are missing and cannot be compared. The anal cirri in specimen of Ehlers (1897) are very long, which suggest that this species should belong to genus <em>Hypereteone </em>Bergström, 1914 (see Wilson, 1988) and so likely does the specimen collected from the Falkland Islands here. Until the complete specimen is available, we assign this species to  <em>Eteone</em> cf. <em>aurantiaca</em>.</p>

Proboscis not observed. Four pairs of tentacular cirri; cirri of segment 1, dorsal and ventral cirri of segment 2, and dorsal cirri of segment 3 cylindrical, with long, tapered ends; cirri of segment 1 reaching segments  4-5. Dorsal cirri of segments 2 and 3 reaching about segment 10. Ventral cirri of segment 2 reaching segment 4-5.                                                    </p>
<p>Parapodia uniramous; europodial lobes long, with both lobes of similar length. Dorsal cirri large, foliose, changing throughout the body in the following fashion: anterior – broad and rounded to ovoid (increasing in size posteriorly); mid body – distally distinctly truncated, acquiring subrectangular form (largest); posterior – decreasing in size, oval to rounded. Ventral cirri of similar throughout, elongated, tapering into pronounced tip; changing in size with those in mid body region largest. Chaetae compound spinigers with very slender blades, tapering into extremely long thing tips; rostrum of chaetal shaft number of fine serrations; anteriorly about 15 per fascicle; in mid-body about 25 per fascicle. Additionally, in midbody chaetigers a single, very thin simple capillary observed in the ventralmost position in the chaetal fascicle. Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Additional information. </strong>As part of taxonomic standardization exercise, other very similar specimens from Falkland Islands became available for examination. One specimen had an everted proboscis: proximal part with 12 rows (6 on each side) with about 8 papillae per row and single mid dorsal row with 4 papillae, subdistal part of proboscis with large irregular mounds; distally with circlet of ~17 small rounded papillae.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Proboscis was not everted in otherwise well preserved voucher, but additional specimens became available for examination and proboscis of one individual was cleraly observed, confirming the presence of the single dorsomedian row of papillae as in <em>P. patagonica</em> (see separate entry with comments on genus <em>Phyllodoce</em> from the region). Distinctly truncated, subrectangular shape of dorsal cirri in median segments was confirmed in voucher specimen, specimens further suggesting similarities to <em>P. patagonica</em>, but also <em>P. truncata</em> (see separate entry with comments on genus <em>Phyllodoce</em> from the region). Unfortunately, the dorsal cirri in specimen with everted proboscis were mostly missing, with most posterior one present around segment 30, where the fully truncated shaped has not been yet developed. Further there is some variation in anteriormost dorsal cirri, which can be rounded, broadly oval to elongated oval (see comparative images). Molecular evidence may be needed to confirm if differences observed here represent different species. For now we suggest to include these under <em>Phyllodoce patagonica</em> complex.</p>

<p><strong><em>Phyllodoce</em> Lamarck, 1818</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Phyllodoce</em>  sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>VINSON WEST: station 5MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.  </strong>Voucher is medium sized, incomplete specimen, 12mm long and about 1mm wide (including parapodia) for 50 chaetigers; colour in alcohol pale pink, no pigmentation except for very small brown patch, on dorsum of the first segment.</p>
<p>Prostomium anteriorly rounded, about as wide as long; with two pairs of prostomial appendages of similar form, short and cirriform: pair of antennae and pair of palps; with pair of red, subdermal eyes in the middle of prostomium; nuchal papilla not observed. Proboscis partially everted, with the proximal part observable; proboscis covered by soft, brown pigmented papillae arranged in 12 (6 on each side) rows and single dorsomedian row of papillae; the number of papillae per row not fully observed (likely 10 or more for paired rows and possibly about 7 per single row); distal part of proboscis not observed.</p>
<p>Four pairs of tentacular cirri; cirri of segment 1, dorsal and ventral cirri of segment 2, and dorsal cirri of segment 3 cylindrical, with long, tapered ends; cirri of segment 1 reaching segments  6-7, with brown spot near their bases; dorsal cirri of segments 2 and 3 reaching about segment 14. Ventral cirri of segment 2 reaching segment 6-7.                                                    </p>
<p>Parapodia uniramous; neuropodial lobes long, with both lobes of similar length. Dorsal cirri large, foliose, mostly missing from the posterior end of the fragments, changing throughout the body in the following fashion: anterior – oval (increasing in size posteriorly); mid body – approaching rhomboid shape; slightly longer wide.</p>
<p>Ventral cirri similar throughout, elongated, widest near the base, then tapering, ending in sharp, slender, elongated tip; changing in size with those in mid body region largest. Chaetae compound spinigers with very slender blades, tapering into extremely long thing tips; rostrum of chaetal shaft number of fine serrations; anteriorly Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Proboscis was at least partially everted in the voucher specimen, confirming presence of the single dorsomedian row of papillae as in <em>P. patagonica</em> (see separate entry with comments on genus <em>Phyllodoce</em> from the region). However unlike in other <em>Phyllodoce</em> species collected here from Falkland Islands, the dorsal cirri of mid-body segments are not distinctly truncated and subrectangular but somewhat rhomboid (see comparative image). Further, ventral cirri have very sharp, elongated tips and specimen lacks pigmentation (except for very faint small patch on dorsum of segment 1). Due to these easily observable differences, we assign this species to <em>Phyllodoce </em>sp. 1, which likely represent a new species.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong> Small, slender species; voucher specimen complete, but pygidium damaged; 6.5mm long and 0.3mm wide (including parapodia) for 70 segments; preserved specimen pale yellow in colour, although posterior part of the body with light orange pigmentation, particularly on dorsal and ventral cirri.                                                                                                                                                   </p>
<p>Prostomium subpentagonal (about as wide as long); eyes absent; with two pairs of prostomial appendages of similar form, short and cirriform: pair of antennae and pair of palps. Proboscis not observed. Tentacular cirri all missing, their number and arrangement uncertain (scars not clearly observed even after staining).                                                                                                                                                    </p>
<p>Dorsal cirri oval, not inflated, not pigmented (except for the posterior part of the body, where orange in colour). Ventral cirri similar to dorsal cirri, but smaller, not pigmented (except for the posterior part of the body). Neuropodia conical, chaetigerous lobes, of similar length; with one acicular and up to 7 chaetae. Chaetae compound spinigers, with unidentate blades of varying lengths, decreasing in size ventrally – the dorsalmost chaeta with extremely long thin blades, the ventralmost chaetae with short almost falciger-like blades; chaetal rostrum asymmetrical with series of smaller serrations. Pygidium not clearly observed, damaged.</p>
<p><strong>Additional observations: </strong>Voucher VINSON WEST: station 38MFB is very similar to the species above, but it is strongly pigmented, with body dark yellow to orange in colour and both dorsal and ventral cirri with dark red pigments; specimens is very short fragment of 15 segments (1.2mm long; 0.3mm wide), but anterior end is well preserved. Specimen has 4 pairs of tentacular cirri and it is consistent with genus <em>Protomystides.</em> Four pairs of tentacular cirri in 1+2+1 arrangement (cirri of segment 1, dorsal and ventral cirri of segment 2, and dorsal cirri of segment 3), all slender, cylindrical, with long, tapered ends; cirri of segment 1 and ventral cirri of segment 2 shorter than dorsal cirri of segments 2 and cirri of segment 3, which are long reaching to about segment 7. Chaetal blades are broken off. It is not clear currently if the two vouchers represent the same species given the differences in colouration.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.  </strong>Currently, there are no known species in genus <em>Protomystides </em>known form the area. Further work will be necessary to establish if Falkland Islands specimens represent new species, which is for now assigned to morphospecies <em>Protomystides </em>sp. 1. The two colourmorphs may represent different species, but we are currently unable to resolve this problem without greater number of well-preserved specimens and molecular evidence.</p>

<p>Examination of <em>Phyllodoce</em> species collected from Falkland Islands suggests the presence of at least 4 forms with affinities to <em>P. patagonica</em> based on form of the proboscis with dorsomedian row of papillae and truncated, subrectangular dorsal cirri in mid-body segments and are here treated as <em>P. patagonica </em>complex until molecular evidence becomes available. Additionally, morphospecies <em>Phyllodoce </em>sp. 1. with similar form of proboscis has also been recorded, but it lacks pigmentation, and dorsal cirri of mid body segments are rhomboid rather than truncated (see comparative image of <em>Phyllodoce </em>species).</p>

"<a href=""/node/319"">Sabellidae</a>"," <p align=""center""><strong>Sabellidae Laterille, 1825</strong></p>
<p>Together with Terebellidae, Sabellidae were the most species rich (and taxonomically challenging!) family collected from Falkland Islands (with S >20). Some genera such as <em>Jasmineira, Euchone</em> <em>and Amphicorina </em>were particularly species rich. Existing descriptions of Sabellidae from the geographical region of interest here are often brief/incomplete and this group would greatly benefit from the revision and re-description of holotypes (where possible) as many characters, particularly those of the branchial crown, have not been discussed by earlier taxonomist. As a result many Sabellidae species were misidentified in the past as some recent provisional work demonstrated, particularly for genus <em>Perkinsiana</em> and related genera (see Knight-Jones, 1983, Giangrande and Gambi, 1997 and Tovar-Hernández et al., 2012 for details). Here we attempt to give a complete description of species collected from Falkland Islands as possible, given constrains of completeness of material and taxonomic expertise. Inevitably, characters derived from the branchial crown were not always possible to determine when the crown was missing. Further, this section of the guide would greatly benefit from the input by sabellid specialists as assignment to some genera is uncertain (denoted by “?”) and interpretation of some characters related to branchial crown can be problematic. Taxonomic key to Sabellidae genera provided by Tovar-Hernández (2010) was used to establish generic identifications. Useful introduction to taxonomic characters of Sabellidae (and Fabriciidae) was provided by Giangrande et al. (2015).</p>

<p><strong>cf. <em>Novafabricia</em> sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>Vinson West: Station 2MFA</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>. Very small, short species; voucher complete specimen with branchial crown; length 1.1mm plus 0.25mm for branchial crown; body width  0.1mm; body cylindrical, narrow, tapered anteriorly and posteriorly; preserved specimens white to pale yellow; body with eight thoracic and three abdominal chaetigers.</p>
<p>Branchial crown with three pairs of radioles; distal ends filamentous, same width as pinnules; ventral filaments absent. Anterior margin of anterior peristomial ring a low ridge dorsally and laterally; ventrally a well-developed tongue-like lobe. Peristomial eyes not observed.</p>
<p>Superior thoracic notosetae elongated, narrowly hooded. Inferior thoracic notosetae and pseudospatulate chaetae not confirmed (due to damage and very small size of specimen); thoracic acicular uncini in a single irregular row, 5 per fascicle. Abdominal uncini, not observed in detail using light microscopy.</p>
<p>Pygidium conical lobe, pygidial eyes no observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>This species is represented by an extremely small, fragile and somewhat damaged specimen therefore not all characters could have been established. The combination of observed characters points to genus <em>Novofabricia</em> because of collar with well-developed ventral lobe, absence of ventral filaments however the degree of fusion of ventral lips with radiole and distribution of pseudospatulate chaetae cannot be established with certainty.</p>
<p>Genus <em>Novafabricia </em>is represented by a single species so far known from the area investigated here.<em> N. chilensis</em> was described from Chile, shallow water. However even though FI specimen is problematic, it is possible to detect some differences to <em>N. chilensis</em>, which has black peristomial and pygidial eyes present in preserved specimens and thoracic acicular uncini are in distinct double rows with 9-14 per fascicle, rather than 5 uncini arranged in a single row as in FI specimens. Another genus reported from deeper Southern Ocean waters is R<em>aficiba</em>, Fitzhugh 2001, represented by <em>Raficiba barryi</em>, which differs from FI specimen by presence of black peristomial and pygidial eyes and more elongate, scoop-like shape of the collar. FI specimen most likely represents another new species in the family Fabriciidae, third reported in this study. However, greater number of well-preserved specimens will be necessary to establish all characters and generic identity with confidence.</p>

"<a href=""/node/315"">Polychaeta</a>"," <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The Taxonomic Guide to benthic polychaetes of the Falkland Islands is an extension of the benthic environmental assessment and monitoring programmes (EAMPs) accompanying oil exploration in the region. A large collection of around 25000 polychaete specimens resulted from two benthic surveys carried out in 2011-2012 and processed at the Natural History Museum (NHM) London. Besides the immediate goal of EAMPs, such collections offer a great potential for systematics and biodiversity research, opportunity which is often not realized. The aim of this current project was to make benthic collections from these EAMPs available for further research. Polychaete worms are the first group to be processed. The project has two main goals:</p>
<ol><li>
		Taxonomic guide to standardize identification.</li>
<li>
		Curation of sample collection at NHM London to facilitate access to these collections.</li>
</ol><p>The two objectives are closely linked. The need for standardized taxonomic guide is immediately linked to EAMPs, which are carried out by a number of Environmental Consultancies (ECs). Simply put, it provides a single source for identification of polychaete, making sure that everyone calls the same species with the same name.</p>
<p>Funding for this work was made available through The South Atlantic Environmental Research Institute (SAERI) and the Natural History Museum, London.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Falklands Fauna</strong></em></p>
<p>Marine benthic fauna from the Falklands area has been considered to be part of the Magellanic province, but links were also drawn to the Southern Ocean and sub-Antarctic fauna.  Available taxonomic monographs for these regions (Hartman 1966; 1967; 1978; Hartmann-Schröder 1962; 1956; Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt 1988; 1989; 1990; 1991; 1992) are in need of an update.  Recent taxonomic efforts concentrated on the polychaete family Ampharetidae  (Schüller and  Jirkov, 2013) exemplified the problems summed up in the following statement: “The Southern Ocean and also Patagonian waters represent an interesting geographical region, as many species recorded from these areas were originally described from the Northern hemisphere (compare e.g., Hartman 1966; 1967; 1978; Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt 1988; 1989; 1990; 1991; 1992). These records from Southern waters may possibly be the result of misidentification and give some substance for the discovery of new species from already well-defined genera. During the 20th and early 21st centuries, frequent expeditions were undertaken in the Southern Ocean. In the samples from the ANDEEP I–III expeditions to the deep Weddell Sea (2002, 2005) over 450 ampharetid specimens belonging to over 20 species (Schüller 2008; Schüller et al. 2009) have been found, many of which are undescribed”. We concur that this is also a problem for other polychaete families. Therefore returning to the first objective – the taxonomic guide- is to provide a standardized taxonomic resource, particularly those species that are currently not formally described (“the unknowns”).</p>
<p>The large number of species new to science, outdated taxonomic literature and need for taxonomic revisions as scientific knowledge evolves demonstrate the need for accessibility of collections such as those from Falkland Islands to as many taxonomic experts as possible. Making collections available to the research community is an important part of the curatorial function of institutions such as NHM London, which was the second objective of this project.  The taxonomic guides itself is an identification tool and its aim was not to solve taxonomic problems, which are merely highlighted, stressing the need for future work by taxonomic experts for particular groups.</p>

"<a href=""/node/314"">Clymenura sp. 1</a>"," <p><strong>Euclymeninae Arwidsson, 1906</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Clymenura</em> Verrill, 1900</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Clymenu</em>ra sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>SEA LION: station 3MFC and (tentatively) TOROA: station T4FA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> SEA LION Voucher is a medium sized, incomplete specimen; 15mm long and 0.6mm wide for 11 chaetigers long fragment; preserved specimen light pink in colour. Chaetigers 1-6 about 1mm long (longer than wide) and distinctly separated by deep intersegmental grooves; chaetiger 7-8  of similar length but without pronounced segmental furrow; chaetigers 9 – 11 (end of fragment) much longer, fused. Chaetiger 8 with a distinct semi-circular glandular pad on dorsum as typical for this genus, pad is almost as long as the chaetiger 8.                </p>
<p>Prostomium with well-developed cephalic plaque; cephalic rim with lateral (one on each side) and single mid-dorsal notches, anteriorly with shallow dips near mid-anterior peak (not developed into palpode). Nuchal organs wide and straight, slightly diverging anteriorly, about ½ the length of plaque, bordering a very low lying keel-like structure. The posterior half of cephalic plaque with faint horizontal lines (not fully developed into ridges).                                                                                                                                                </p>
<p>Notochaetae capillaries of two types – long, smooth, very narrowly limbate chaetae (about 4 per fascicle) and more numerous (about 8 per fascicle) shorter simple, very thin capillaries. ). In chaetigers 1 -3 single neuropodial rostrate hook present, dentition of these uncini well developed;  from chaetiger 4 about 10 rostrate uncini arranged in irregular single row, uncini with main fang and 4 small teeth, up to 4 thin barbells underneath the main fang; with  manubrial constriction on its shaft. Posterior end and pygidium not observed. Tube not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Additional notes:</strong>  As part of taxonomic intercalibration exercise, additional specimen of <em>Clymenura </em>collected from Falkland Islands became available for examination. These possessed pygidial (although fragmented, no complete specimen was observed). The posterior ends of these specimens (otherwise consistent with SEA LION voucher described above) were of following form:  5 pre-pygidial rings (segments without chaetae); anal plaque with few thin cirri, largely differing in length with at least 3 long ones bordered by few shorter ones (three pygidia were available for examination, 3 long cirri were always present, but the number of shorter ones varied); cirri never developed on the dorsal side.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.  </strong>Falkland Island specimens are consistent with genus <em>Clymenura </em>as they possess ventral pad on chaetiger 8; well-developed cephalic plaque and neuropodia of chaetigers 1-3 with a low number (one) of  rostrate uncini. Currently, there are no known species of <em>Clymenura</em> from the region (<em>Leiochone singularis</em> Gravier, 1907 is considered a nomen dubium). Of the known <em>Clymenura </em>species, FI specimen are most similar to <em>C. borealis</em> from Northern Europe and <em>C. lankesteri</em> from Japan which also possess 5 or 5-6 pre-pygidial rings (other species have only 2-3), have cephalic rim with lateral and dorsal notches and reduced number of uncini in first chaetiger as well as reduced dentition in these uncini, the pygidial cirri are all long and thin. Falkland specimens appear to differ in not having ocelli and in possessing few anal cirri of varying length, although it is not clear if some are just missing. Falkland Island specimens likely represent a new species, but currently it is unclear if there are more than species of <em>Clymenura </em>present as no complete specimen has been found so far. For the same reason, it is unclear if the two voucher specimens represent the same species, but based on currently available morphological evidence, the two specimens share characters, mentioned above.</p>

<p>Maldanidae is a species rich family in Falkland Islands’ waters. Specimens were often heavily fragmented and incomplete as is typical for maldanids.  Not all species could have been unambiguously assigned to a genus, therefore some were identified to subfamily only. The available taxonomic literature from the region is problematic with regards to this family and in need of an update.</p>

<p><strong>Euclymeninae sp. 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>ENDEAVOUR: station E4FA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Very slender species with very long segment (possibly damaged –stretched?); voucher is the only example collected; assumed incomplete as only 12 chaetigers present; posterior part possibly damaged (uncertain if true pygidium present); 18mm long and 0.3mm wide. Chaetiger very slender and long, chaetiger about 0.5mm long, chaetigers 2 – 4, around 1mm long, subsequent chaetigers  >2mm long.</p>
<p>Prostomium fused to peristomium; cephalic plaque present, strongly arched, rounded anteriorly (not extended into palpode); with very low rim, anteriorly smooth; posteriorly somewhat crenulated; straight, anteriorly diverging nuchal organs in posterior part of prostomium. Eyes or ocelli not observed.</p>
<p>Notochaetae few (3-5? per fascicle), often broken off, at least 3 types observed: rather short spatula chaeta; long, thick, bilimbate chaeta with fine tip and short, thin, capillaries (about 1- 3 per fascicle).</p>
<p>Uncini present from chaetiger 1; all rostrate hooks; increasing in number from 3 in chaetiger 1 to up to 8 in mid-body chaetigers. Each uncinus with main fang and about 6 smaller teeth, without fibrils, but with a small hood below the main fang; long, bent shaft with a pronounced localized swelling (breast) in the middle.</p>
<p>Preanal segments not obvious.  Pygidium (if real rather than damaged), very small, asymmetrical, with numerous, irregular, short, rounded lobes.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Generic identity of this incomplete specimen is uncertain and we adopt a conservative approach to identifying it only to a sub-family. Voucher agrees with family Euclymeninae as it has a head with plaque, neurochaetae from chaetiger 1 and reduced in number in first 3 chaetigers. It is not clear if the specimen is complete, the posterior end is most likely damaged/regenerating.</p>

<p><strong>Vouchers. VINSON WEST: station 3MFB and 4MFB.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong> Small and slender species; voucher incomplete; a single anterior fragment with 13 chaetigers, 7mm long and 0.25mm wide; colour is whitish to pale yellow.                                                                          </p>
<p>Prostomium without cephalic plaque, but with high cephalic keel; prostomium narrow, slightly elongated, “hood” shaped; together with peristomium separated from the first chaetiger by a segmental furrow, without dorsal crest.  Chaetigers 1 - 8, long and narrow (about 2-3 times longer than wide); chaetigers 9 – 13 (end of fragments), extremely long (up to 8 times longer than wide). Ventral glandular shields or segmental collars not observed. </p>
<p>Chaetigers 1-4 with notochaetae only; notochaetae few, narrowly limbate shorter and longer capillaries. Uncini from chaetiger 5, where few (about 5) arranged in a single row, in subsequent chaetigers increasing in number and become arranged in irregular to double rows; from chaetiger 8, more distinctly arranged in 2 semicircular rows on slightly raised fleshy pads, until the end of fragment (=chaetiger 13). The uncini have a large main fang surmounted by about 4 vertical rows of small teeth in frontal view, as 3 smaller teeth above the main fang in lateral view ; breast of uncini with a stout subrostral spine above basal prow; basal prow thick.                                                                                    </p>
<p>Posterior part and pygidium not observed. Tube: specimen from station 4MFB with small remnant of the tube; appear loose, composed of coarse black particles, adorned with few tests of foraminifera.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.  </strong>This is a rather interesting species which belongs to the rather rare, species-poor subfamily Bogueinae Hartman & Fauchald, 1971, although characters derived from posterior part of the body cannot be confirmed. It resembles <em>Rhodine</em> in lacking cephalic plaque and having uncini arranged in double and single rows, with their start from chaetiger 5 (also 4 in Bogueinae). However Bogueinae lack segmental collars and vary in other characters (see Wolf, 1983 for details).  Of the two genera of Bogueinae, Falkland Islands specimens agree with genus <em>Boguea </em>in having uncini from chaetiger 5 rather than 4 as in <em>Boguella</em>. Each genus contains only one species and both were re-described by Wolf (1983). <em>Boguea enigmatica</em> has been described from the southern part of the USA Atlantic coast from shallow waters (2 – 101m). Unfortunately, Falkland Islands specimens are very short, incomplete and not all characters can be compared. They likely represent a new species as only smooth, limbate notochaetae were observed, uncini from anterior part of the body are of different form (see comparative image) and dimensions of body segments differ from <em>B. enigmatica</em> (segments appear of similar length in drawing provided by Wolf, 1983). Complete specimens will be necessary to fully diagnose this species and provide full comparison with <em>B. enigmatica. </em></p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong> Large species; voucher complete; slightly desiccated; 38mm long and 1.2mm wide for 19 chaetigers; colour in alcohol pale yellow; tube partially preserved.</p>
<p>Prostomium fused with peristomium; without cephalic plaque; with high cephalic keel; prostomium narrow, elongated, anteriorly rounded; nuchal slit, deeply curved; separated from the first chaetiger by an indistinct segmental furrow; followed by a further two indistinct annuli. Chaetigers longer than wide, except for posteriormost chaetigers, which are about as long as wide; all segmentation relatively indistinct, with very shallow segmental furrows; chaetigers 1-3 biannulate. Notochaetae of two type, long, thick and smooth bilimbate chateae (about 5 per fascicle in anterior chaetigers) and shorter to long, slender, distally hirstue chaetae (about 10 per fascicle in anterior chaetigers). Uncini from chaetiger 1; in chaetigers 1- 4 as one or two large, stout, blunt, honey-coloured spines; from chaetiger 5 as rostrate hooks; each hook has a large main fang surmounted by 3 smaller teeth; few (about 2) slender fibrilis and small swelling below the main fang, handle long; up to 8 per fascicle in mid-body segments, reduced to 4 in the last chaetiger.</p>
<p>Posterior part (posteriormost chaetigers and pre-anal achaetigerous segments) inflated (damaged, artefact of preservation?) and not clearly segmented, exact numbe of pre-anal segments difficult to establish; abruptly narrowing into short, slender, pygidial cone. Pygidial cone dorsally, with small, overhanging, rounded flap. Tube soft (easy to open); internally as a soft muddy lattice; externally adorned with tightly packed, coarse, medium sized particles, mostly black and white, giving speckled appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong>  This species is represented by a single, but complete specimen in Falkland Islands collection. Only one species in genus <em>Lumbriclymenella </em>(no species in similar genus <em>Lumbriclymene</em>) is known from the region.  <em>Lumbriclymenella robusta</em> Arwidsson, 1911 (type locality: South Georgia, depth 75m; subsequently reported from Falkland Islands by Fauvel, (1916)) agrees in possessing 19 chaetigers. However the following differences were noted from <em>L. robusta</em> (based on images accompanying description of Arwidsson in Hartman (1966): no red pigmentation of anterior end; hooks with swelling below the main fang, with fibrils (however some hooks may lack fibrils); posterior end inflated (this may be artefact of preservation), not distinctly segmented.  Deep-sea species <em>Lumbriclymenella nasuta </em>(Wesenberg-Lund, 1948; type locality Greenland, 2258 m) has been recently re-described by Kongsgrud et al. (2013) and it is also very similar to both <em>L. robusta</em> and Falkland Islands specimens. More specimens from Falkland Islands need to be collected and compared with type specimens of other <em>Lumbriclymenella </em>species to establish if this represent a new species.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Extremely small specimen, probably a larval stage as segmentation is not fully completed; chaetae developed; body spindle shaped (widest in the middle and narrowing anteriorly and posteriorly); 2mm long, 0.12mm wide; preserved specimen pale yellow.</p>
<p>Prostomium fused to peristomium, rounded anteriorly, forming a slight arched dorsal keel (resembling head of <em>Rhodine</em>).</p>
<p>Notochaetae of two types: straight, smooth, appearing narrowly limbate under light microscopy, 2 per fascicle observed, and single short, spatulate, lancet-shaped chaetae in each fascicle. Neuropodia not observed in first chaetiger with notochaetae, but present in all other chaetigers , very few per ramus – chaetiger 2 with 1 uncinus increasing to maximum number of 3 uncini in mid body chaetigers, thereafter decreasing to 1 in the last chaetiger. Uncini strongly curved with long shafts and swelling on the breast; main fang surmounted with few (number not clearly observed) smaller teeth; with large rostrated tooth below the main fan, fibrils not observed. Pre-anal achaetigerous segment/s likely present, but not clearly visible. Anal plaque likely not fully developed yet (larval character) or alternatively missing.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> Recently, Darbyshire (2013) described a new species <em>Micromaldane shackletoni</em>  from Falkland Islands, intertidal depths and provided comparative table to all know species in this genus.</p>
<p>However Falkland Island specimen collected here, from slope depths (~1000m) is not the same species as <em>M. shackletoni </em>as it clearly has spatulate, lancet notochaeta, rather than narrow ones. Only two of the known species of <em>Micromaldane </em>possess spatulate chaetae – the type species of the genus <em>M. ornithochaeta </em>Mesnil, 1897 (type locality: France, know considered cosmopolitan, including the records of Fauvel (1916) from the Southern Ocean) and <em>M. jonesi</em> Achari, 1968 known from India.                                                                                                                                                                  </p>
<p>Given the extremely small size, low number of chaetigers and incomplete segmentation, it is likely that this specimen represents the advanced larval stage (see discussion in Darbyshire, 2013) and it is not assigned to any species until more specimens become available.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Complete specimen; small to medium sized, slender species; 20mm long and 0.4mm wide for 22 chaetigers and two pre-anal achaetous segments; colour in alcohol light pink, with redish brown pigments anteriorly on ventrum of chaetigers 1-5 (most pronounced on chaetigers 2 and 3). Chaetigers 1 – 6 short (about twice as long as wide), chaetigers 7 – 12 long; from around chaetiger 13 getting progressively shorter again, with the last 2 chaetigers and 2 pre-anal segments very short.                                                                                                 </p>
<p>Prostomium fused to peristomium; without cephalic plaque; rounded, forming hood-like projection overhanging mouth with greatly arched cephalic keel; nuchal grooves as parallel slightly pigmented slits.</p>
<p>Notopodia of chaetigers 1–22 with fascicles of long and narrow capillary chaetae of two types; long, very thin and sparsely hirsute along most of its shaft (about 2 per fascicle) and smooth, stout, narrowly limbate chaetae (about 5 per fascicle). Additionally, from chaetiger 5 a single, very long, thin and often spiralled chaeta present; its posterior distribution uncertain. Neuropodia of chaetigers 1–3 with a single large, stout, dark yellow, pointed acicular spine. Posterior to chaetiger 4, neuropodia with a row of rostrate uncini. Each uncinus with a main fang and 4 small teeth; with long, and up to 4 thin fibrils (barbels) below main fang; number of rostrate uncini variable, with up to 6 observed.                             </p>
<p>Two very short, equal, pre-anal achaetous segments present.  Anal funnel symmetrical, cup-shaped,  with relatively shallow-rim bearing 17 short, sub-triangular, equal-sized anal cirri.  Anus terminal, located in center of funnel.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Comparative table of all known <em>Nichomache </em>species was recently given by De Assiz et al. (2007). So far two <em>Nichomache</em> species are known from the region of interest here.  <em>N. lumbricalis</em> , is an assumed cosmopolitan species, but it seems  doubtful that Southern Ocean records belong to the Northern European species. The drawing and description in Hartman (1966) shows a smooth anal plaque, without any cirri while comparative table of all <em>Nichomache</em> species provided by de Assis et al. (2007) states anal plaque as cup shaped bordered by 17-31 asymmetrical cirri. Another report of <em>N. lumbricalis</em> by Hartman (1967) includes a record (denoted by “?”) from Falklands Is. in 646-845m. This record is accompanied by very brief description of posterior end only, which states that:” …(anal) plaque surrounded by a circlet of 17-21 fringes; all are about equally short. The last setigerous segment is followed by two segments without chaetae”.  This is consistent with the form of anal plaque in FI specimens found here. Further work would be necessary to establish if this really represents a new species different form Northern European <em>Nichomache </em>cf. <em>lumbricalis</em>, therefore the FI specimens are assigned to  <em>Nichomache lumbricalis</em> (Fabricius, 1780) <em>sensu </em>Hartman, 1967.</p>
<p><em>N. monroi </em>was described from Bismarck Strait in 93-315m by Hartman (1967) but it differs from the current species because it possesses about 30 papillae bordering the anal plaque preceded by 2 achaetous segments and up to 2 spines in first three neuropodia.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks.  </strong>Specimen is consistent with genus <em>Rhodine</em> in possessing collared segments, uncini from chaetiger 5, arranged in double rows on several anterior chaetigers. <em>Rhodine </em>is a small genus with some species considered to have a cosmopolitan distribution, the last description of new <em>Rhodine</em> species dates to 1911. Of the <em>Rhodine</em> species previously reported from the region: <em>R. antarctica, R. intermedia </em>and<em> R. loveni</em>, the FI specimens appear to be most similar to <em>R. antarctica</em> (see table below), mostly due to dimensions of body segments, lack of obvious dorsal crest and presence of ventral shields on chaetigers 4-9 (presumably, Gravier (1911) reported these as “Aux quatrième, cinquième, sixième, septième, huitième et neuvième sétigères, on observe des anneaux blancs”). However full distribution of uncini with double rows as well as characters derive from the posterior, particularly the form of pygidium cannot be established. Other species belonging to genus <em>Rhodine</em> were also encountered in Falkland Islands collection and these species are compared in table below.</p>

<p><strong>Vouchers. LOLIGO: station L11FA.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong> Medium-sized species, voucher incomplete; with 17 chaetigers-long in total fragmented into anterior fragment of 8 chaetigers (25mm long and 2mm wide) and additional 5 body fragments of varying lengths; colour in alcohol pale to yellow.</p>
<p>Prostomium (both specimens) without cephalic plaque, but with high cephalic keel; prostomium together with peristomium fused with first chaetiger, with a well-developed dorsal crest. First chaetiger long (much longer than wide); chaetiger 2 short (about as long as wide), rounded; chaetiger 3 long again, chaetigers short from chaetiger 4 until end of anterior fragments, rounded. Chaetigers 2 and 3 with well-developed segmental collar; anterior margin of collar, middorsally with a wide, very shallow depression; well-developed collars also observed on at least 3 other fragmented body segments (likely from mid or posterior part of the body).  From chaetiger 3-9 ventral glandular shields present on the anterior half of segment.                                                                                                                                                                   </p>
<p>Chaetigers 1-4 with notochaetae only; notochaetae comprise long and short narrowly-limbate capillaries. Uncini from chaetiger 5 arranged in double, interlocking rows, uncini in such arrangement until chaetiger 14, with about 48 uncini per row; from chaetiger 15 uncini arranged in single row. The uncini have a large main fang surmounted by several rows of small teeth; breast of uncini with a stout subrostral spine above basal prow; with medium length handle.                                                                                                                                        </p>
<p>Posterior part and pygidium not observed. Tube not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.  </strong>Specimen is consistent with genus <em>Rhodine</em> in possessing collared segments, uncini from chaetiger 5, arranged in double rows on several anterior chaetigers. <em>Rhodine </em>is a small genus with some species considered to have a cosmopolitan distribution, the last description of new <em>Rhodine</em> species dates to 1911. Of<em> Rhodine</em> species previously reported from the region: <em>R. antarctica, R. intermedia </em>and<em> R. loveni</em>, the first two are considered endemic, but the third is cosmopolitan. The features separating the species (particularly <em>R. intermedia </em>and<em> R. loveni</em>) are not clear, but <em>R. antarctica </em>was described from small specimen, while the other two species are large bodied.  Falkland Island specimens are assigned here to <em>R. </em>cf.<em> intermedia</em> (see table below) (holotype of R. intermedia was collected in South Georgia) rather than to cosmopolitan <em>R. loveni</em>.  Further, characters derived from the posterior, particularly the form of pygidium cannot be established and chaetiger 2 is short not long in Falkland Island specimen (limitation of having only heavily fragmented specimens available needs to be taken into account). Other species belonging to this genus were also encountered in Falkland Islands collection and these are compared in the table below.</p>

<p><strong><em>Clymenura</em> Verrill, 1900</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Clymenu</em>ra sp. 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>SEA LION: station 3MFC.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Voucher is a small to medium sized, incomplete specimen; 16mm long and 0.5mm wide for 15 chaetigers long fragment; preserved specimen pale yellow in colour. Chaetigers 1-2 very long (>2mm long), chaetigers 3 slightly shorter, chaetigers 4 – 8 short (about 1mm) and chaetigers 9 -14 about 0.5mm long, with chaetiger 15 getting longer again. Chaetigers 1-8 distantly separated by deep intersegmental grooves; chaetigers 9 -14 with segmentation indistinct, chaetiger 15 with distinct segmentation again. Chaetiger 8 with a large, semi-circular glandular pad on dorsum as typical for this genus, the pad as long as the chaetiger 8.                                                                                                            </p>
<p>Prostomium with well-developed cephalic plaque; cephalic rim with lateral (one on each side) and single mid-dorsal notches, anteriorly with shallow dips near mid-anterior peak (not developed into palpode). Nuchal organs wide and straight, bordering a very low lying keel-like structure, covering nearly full length of cephalic plaque.                                                                                                                                               </p>
<p>Notochaetae capillaries of two types – long, smooth, very narrowly-limbate chaetae (about 8 per fascicle) and more numerous (about 10 per fascicle) shorter capillaries. In chaetigers 1 -3 single neuropodial rostrate hook present, dentition of these uncini reduced; from chaetiger 4 approximately 8 rostrate uncini arranged in a single row; uncini with main fang and about 6 small teeth, with several thin fibrils (barbells) underneath the main fang; with manubrial constriction on its shaft. Posterior end and pygidium not observed. Tube not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.  </strong>Falkland Island specimens are consistent with genus <em>Clymenura </em>as they possess ventral pad on chaetiger 8; well-developed cephalic plaque and neuropodia of chaetigers 1-3 with a low number (one) of rostrate uncini. Currently, there are no known species of <em>Clymenura</em> from the region (<em>Leiochone singularis</em> Gravier, 1907 is considered a nomen dubium). Another specimen consistent with genus <em>Clymenura</em> and assigned to morphospecies <em>Clymenrua </em>sp. 1 likely represent a different species. It mainly differs in the length of chaetigers (<em>Clymenura </em>sp. 1 has shorter chaetigers anteriorly and longer posteriorly, while <em>Clymenura </em>sp. 2 has opposite trend), the length of cephalic  keel  and development of dentition of uncini in chaetigers 1 -3. No complete specimens were found to date.</p>

<p><strong><em>Notoproctus </em></strong><strong>sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>LOLIGO: station L 14FB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Small slender species; voucher complete (in 2 fragments); 16mm long and 0.3mm wide for 18 chaetigers. Anterior and posterior chaetiger short (about as long as wide), the mid-body chaetigers very long.</p>
<p>Prostomium fused to peristomium, forming a well-defined head with very low rim cephalic peak, strongly arched and rounded anteriorly. Nuchal grooves strongly curved outwards (arch-shaped). Eyes or ocelli not observed.</p>
<p>Notochaetae of two types -  long, thick, bilimbate capillaries with fine tips, around 3 per fascicle and short, thin, distally hirsute capillaries, about 3-4 per fascicle in anterior chaetigers. Neuropodia of chaetigers 1-4 with a single, stout, acicular spine, distally blunt and rounded, dark yellow in colour. Subsequent neuropodia with row of rostrate hooks, maximum 4 per ramus, reduced to 2 in posteriormost chaetigers.  Each hook with main fang and about 4 small teeth, with fibrils below the main fang; very long shaft with a pronounced localized swelling (breast).</p>
<p>Preanal segments without chaetae indistinct and difficult to establish (may be 2 or 3), similar to preceding chaetigers. Anal plaque present, well developed; strongly arched (perpendicular to the body) and resembles cephalic plaque; very low, smooth cephalic rim with a slight dorsal notch; with high pygidial keel. Anus dorsal, positioned just above the anal plaque. Tube unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Only one species in genus <em>Notoproctus</em> has been previously described from the area as <em>Notoproctus oculatus antarcticus</em> Arwidsson, 1911. Various reports of this species from the region suggest that more than one species could be present and possibly misidentified, particularly as this species is considered to occur from 218 – 5274m (Ehlers, 1913; Monro, 1939; Hartman, 1966,1967). Monro’s (1939) non-type material is housed at NHM collection and was re-examined. As already reported by Monro (1939) one specimen likely belongs to Nichomache. Others consistent with genus Notoproctus, but only one specimen is complete. This specimen is larger than Falkland Island specimens, eyes are absent, cephalic plaque has slight lateral notches, but has no dorsal notch.</p>
<p>Hartman (1966) states 18 chaetigerous and 2 pre-anal segments or 19 chaetigerous and 2 pre-anal segments and eyes absent. Hartman (1967) reported only 3 chaetigers with single spine, not 4.  Ultimately, comparison with holotype of Arwidsson will be necessary, but given the lack of eyes in Falkland Islands specimens these will be assigned to morphospecies <em>Notoproctus</em> sp. 1 until further evidence is available.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Small and slender species;<strong> </strong>voucher specimen complete, with branchial crown; body 1.7 mm long, crown 0.8 mm long, body 0.25 mm wide; with 8 thoracic and 5 short (much wider than long), crowded abdominal segments.</p>
<p>Branchial crown with 3 pairs of radioles; non-vascularized ventral filaments not observed. Distal end of radioles filamentous, without papillae. Collar most developed ventrally as a high lobe, laterally and dorsally as a low lobe; margin smooth with mid-ventral shallow notch; dorsally not forming pockets, not overlapping at midline. Peristomial eyes not observed. Glandular ridge on chaetiger 2 present.</p>
<p>In thorax mucronate chaetae absent, only limbate (hooded) notochaetae found, around 7 per fascicle; thoracic uncini acicular, up to 5 per fascicle, with the larger tooth above the main fang displaced and followed by few small teeth. Abdominal neurochaetae, few, narrowly limbate capillaries. Abdominal uncini rasp-shaped, up to 12 per ramus, arranged in about 6 vertical rows with many (about 20) small teeth per row.</p>
<p>Pygidium triangular lobe, slightly longer than wide; pygidial eyes not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Genus <em>Amphicorina</em> is species rich in the geographical area investigated here, with 9 species reported in literature. The two species reported from FI here are likely to be new species. Of the known species from the geographical area investigated, three <em>Amphicorina</em> species have 5 abdominal segments: <em>A. taltalensis</em>, <em>A. longipyge</em> and <em>A. magna</em> (see table below). Falkland Is. specimens differ in having abdominal uncini with very numerous (around 20) small teeth per each of 6 rows. Other known species have fewer, around 10 (7-12) small teeth per row.</p>

<p><strong>Vouchers. </strong> VINSON WEST: Station 38 MFB and Sea Lion: station 7MFC.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Both vouchers posteriorly incomplete; very small, slender species; 1.1 and 5mm long, 0.15mm wide for anterior fragment with 10 and 40 chaetigers. Integument smooth; colour in alcohol pale yellow. Prostomium about twice as wide as long bearing three antennae and two palps. Palps distinctly longer than prostomium; fused throughout their length. Antennae smooth, arising nearly at same level near posterior margin of prostomium; lateral antennae distinctly shorter, spindle-shaped; median antenna very long (reaching back to chaetiger 3), slender, cirriform. Eyes present as a pair of tiny red eyespots (voucher 38MFB) or as two pairs, anterior pair as large spherical eyes (composed of several small eyespots), posterior pair as large rod-shaped eyes (composed of several small eyespots). Pharyngeal tube extending through 4 chaetigers, proventricle with around 20 muscle rings extending through chaetiger 4-6. First segment achaetous laterally with a pair of smooth, short, ovoid tentacular cirri.</p>
<p>Parapodia uniramous with smooth dorsal cirri similar to tentacular cirri in anterior chaetigers, becoming slightly longer digiform in latter chaetigers; dorsal cirri present in all chaetigers; ventral cirri conical, inserted near parapodial base.</p>
<p>Chaetae of 3 different types: type 1. as simple chaetae (usually one dorsal and one ventral) lacking in anteriormost chaetigers; long, slender, distally bidentate with several long aristae; type 2. as compound falcigerous chaetae with bidentate blades, their lengths decreasing inferiorly; type 3. as compound spinigerous chaetae with long bidentate blades; all compound chaetae distally bidentate; with the teeth widely separated in morphotype with eyes, but this gap appear much smaller in morphotypes with small eyes; all blades serrated with long spines over entire length of margin. Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Falkland Island specimen belongs to two morphotypes with 2 pairs of large eyes (from ~500m depth) or pair of tiny eye spots (~1000m depth). Some minute differences were also observed in the degree of distal dentation of falciger and spiniger-like compound chaetae. Until molecular evidence becomes available, we consider these to be the same species. Both morphotypes correspond well with <em>Exogone wolfi</em>, which in turn has been reported from widespread geographical and bathymetrical ranges showing similar variation in eye development to the one observed here (see comparative Table below). This may possibly represent a species complex and molecular evidence is needed to clarify status of different morphotypes. <em>Exogone minuscula</em> Hartman, 1953 is Southern Ocean species, which is superficially also very similar to FI specimens (morphotypes with eyes), however Hartman reported unidentate not bidentate tips and simple chaetae show subdistal serration, but lack aristae. <em>E. parasexoculata</em> Hartmann-Schröder, 1993 from Argentinean part of the South Atlantic Ocean lack dorsal cirri on 2<sup>nd</sup> chaetiger.</p>

"<a href=""/node/296"">Sphaerosyllis lateropapillata Hartmann-Schröder, 1986</a>"," <p><strong>Exogoninae Langerhans, 1879</strong></p>
<p><strong>Genus<em> Sphaerosyllis </em>Claparède, 1863</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Sphaerosyllis lateropapillata </em>Hartmann-Schröder, 1986</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>LOLIGO station L2FA</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Voucher is a complete specimen (some damage as dorsal cirri on many anterior and mid chaetigers are missing); small, slender species; 5.5 mm long, 0.3mm wide for 54 chaetigers; colour in alcohol pale yellow. Body integument, palps and parapodia papillated; papillation relatively sparse, dorsum more densely papillated then venturm; dorsally a distinct arrangement appears (best observed when Shirla-stained) with 2 longer, slender papillae positioned laterally on each segment, forming regular longitudinal rows across the body; small rounded papillae in between and across the dorsum.</p>
<p>Prostomium about twice as wide as long bearing three antennae and two palps. Palps short, fused along their length, short, slightly ventrally folded, with small papillae. Antennae smooth, flask-shaped, of equal size, with median antenna positioned posteriorly to the lateral ones. Two pairs of large, red eyes in trapezoid arrangement. Pharyngeal tube extending through 4 chaetigers, with proventricle extending through chaetigers 5-7, with about 12 large muscular bands. First segment achaetous laterally with a pair of smooth, short, flask-shaped tentacular cirri (similar to antennae).</p>
<p>Parapodia uniramous, distinct, papillated, with one of the longer lateral papilla positioned near the paprapodial base. Dorsal cirri often missing (missing in most anterior chaetigers), where present flask-shaped (similar to antennae and dorsal cirri) becoming progressively elongated in posterior chaetigers; ventral cirri first clearly observed from chaetiger 20, long thin, cirriform, inserted near parapodial base.</p>
<p>Chaetae of essentially two different types: type 1 simple dorsal chaeta; unidentate, spine-like, present in all chaetigers, anterior one with more acute tip, posterior ones with rounded tip, usually one per fascicle, two observed in mid body segments; simple ventral chaetae not observed (likely broken off); type 2 compound, heterogomph, falcigers with curved, unidentate, falcate blades, blades reduce in length in dorsoventral gradation in anterior parapodia; present in all chaetigers; 7 anteriorly, 5 posteriorly per fascicle. Acicula solitary, distally bent at right angle as typical for the genus. Pygidium wide, round lobe provided with two, lateral, elongated flask-shaped anal cirri (similar to dorsall cirri, but much longer).</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Falkland Island specimens agree well with <em>Sphaerosyllis lateropapillata</em> (Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1992) described from Antarctic Peninsula (63°16.40'S, 63°42.78'W), 300m. As the name suggests papillae are most distinct laterally, where they are longest. San Martín (2005) also reported this species from Australia, although palps seem longer in those specimens compared to those from the Southern Ocean, Falklands Islands.</p>

<p><strong>Vouchers. </strong>VINSON WEST: station 1MFA; ENDEAVOUR: station E4FB (2 specimens).</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>All vouchers posteriorly incomplete; medium sized species; body robust, dorsoventrally flattened, 2-4mm long, 0.5-0.8mm wide for anterior fragments with 18 and 27 chaetigers. Integument smooth; colour in alcohol pale pink to dark yellow; proboscis not everted.</p>
<p>Prostomium much wider than long bearing three antennae and two palps. Palps distinctly longer than prostomium, wide rounded lobes, basally free from each other; distally often folded over. Antennae long, thin, distinctly articulated, positioned anteriorly to eyes;<strong> </strong>lateral antennae slightly shorter (with around 25 articulations) than median antenna (with around 35 articulations).<strong> </strong>Eyes present, 2 pairs, brown-reddish, faint, positioned next to each other in almost horizontal line, with outer pair large cup-shaped, inner pair, small, spherical.<strong> </strong>Pharyngeal tube extending through 10 chaetigers, proventricle with small muscle rings extending through chaetigers 11-25. First segment achaetous laterally with a pair of long, slender, distinctly articulated tentacular cirri (similar to antenna).<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Parapodia uniramous; with long, slender, distinctly articulated dorsal cirri (similar to tentacular cirri and antennae) of alternating lengths, longer ones with about 45 and shorter ones with about 20 articulations; ventral cirri only weakly articulated, slender, long (just surpassing the paprapodia), inserted basally.</p>
<p>Chaetae all compound falcigers, about 6 per fascicle; all with very short, thick, smooth, bidentate blades. Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Ehlers (1901) described <em>S. sclerolaema</em> from Strait of Magellan. Monro (1930) reported this species from Falklands based on 2 damaged specimens, however his illustration of chaetae fits those of specimen collected here well - only falcigers, with few extremely short, thick smooth, distinctly bidentate hooks. However, it is not clear if Ehler's and Monro's specimens represent the same species. Some authors, consider <em>S. scerolaema</em> junior synonym of <em>Haplosyllis spongiphila</em> (Verrill, 1885) (e. g. Blake, 1995). Additionally, Hartmann-Schröder described very similar species <em>Typosyllis bifida</em> from Southern Ocean, South Shetlands, 488m, which however lacks eyes.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher specimens. </strong>Sea Lion: station 79MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Medium sized, robust species; voucher is a complete specimen with branchial crown; 15mm long for body and 7mm long for crown, 1.5mm wide; with eight thoracic and 23 abdominal chaetigers with 7 of these associated with pre-pygidial depression; colour in alcohol pinkish.</p>
<p>Branchial crown with 8 pairs of radioles and 2 pairs of nonvascularized ventral radiolar appendages. Collar well developed, higher ventrally than dorsally, with mid-dorsal margins overlapping, anterior margin entire ventrally with a deep midventral notch. Glandular ridge present on chaetiger 2.</p>
<p>Collar chaetae narrowly-limbate arranged in single longitudinal, somewhat oblique row; notochaetae of two types, superior notochaetae broadly-limbate, inferior notochaetae mucronate (about 8 per fascicle). Thoracic neuropodia uncini aciculae, about 15 per fascicle. Companion chaetae absent. Abdominal chaetae on short, slightly elevated neuropodia, with elongate narrowly limbate chaetae. Notopodia of anterior abdominal chaetigers with quadrate avicular uncini with five rows of similar-sized teeth over main fang, covering half its length, well developed breast and very short handle.</p>
<p>Abdomen with a broad pre-pygidial depression occupying 7 chaetigers, with high raised membranous lateral flanges connected anteriorly by a rounded membrane, flanges lower posteriorly. Pygidium small, bluntly rounded, triangular lobe. Tube not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>There are two known species of <em>Euchone</em> with two types of notochaetae from the area. Hartman (1978) described <em>E. heterosetosa </em>from South Georgia, 2900m. Nearly a decade later Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt (1989) described similar species as <em>E. undulocincta</em> from much shallower depths of 133m off Joiville Island without providing comparison of the two species. These species clearly differ in size (see comparative table of <em>Euchone </em>species know from the area) and Falkland Island specimens are consistent with <em>E. undulocincta</em>, although description by Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt (1989) is rather brief and comparison with holotype is needed for confirmation. Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt (1989), for example, mentioned that the species is unique in possessing the ridge on chaetiger 2, this however is a generic-level character possessed by several sabellid genera.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>SEA LION: station 1MFC and station 8MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Small sized species; all vouchers incomplete, the largest voucher (SEA LION: station 8MFA) 3mm long and 0.8mm wide for 20 chaetiger long fragment. Prostomium subspherical, about as wide as long, with a V-shaped posterior margin, extending over the first chaetiger; a pair of nuchal organs near the posterior corners of prostomium; a pair of conical antennae in the anterior corners of the prostomium and a pair of palps inserted posteriorly on ventrum the prostomium. Proboscis not everted. Branchiae (inter-ramal cirri) involute; appearing abruptly (of similar size to those in subsequent chaetigers) from chaetiger 9; small; present until end of 20 chaetiger long fragment. Parapodia biramous; unadorned - no particularly enlarged lobes present, with the exception of superior lobe over notopodia, which is erect and enlarged (refer to the image for details). Dorsal cirri small, conical in chaetiger 1; from chaetiger 2 small, somewhat foliose, oval, distally abruptly produced into sharp, slender tip (refer to the image). Ventral cirri particularly well developed in chaetiger 1, where skittle-shaped (slender, but with wider base and thin distally); well developed in other chaetigers, tapering, cirriform. Preacicular chaetae stout, cross-barred in both rami. Postacicular chaetae in notopodia long, stouter spinulose and slender (appearing smooth) present; in neuropodia long, slender, appearing faintly cross-barred (articulation longer than in cross-barred pre-acicular chaetae). Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Several <em>Aglaophamus</em> species with<strong> </strong>the late start of<strong> </strong>branchiae and relatively simple, unadorned parapodia similar to the FI specimens are known from the region. <em>A. erectanoides</em> Hartmann-Schröder, 1965 where branchiae appear from chaetigers 8-10,<strong> </strong><em>A. posterobranchus</em> Hartman, 1967 where branchiae start between chaetigers 9-16 (mostly 12), <em>A. groenlandiae</em> Hartman, 1967 with branchiae from chaetiger 12, <em>A. paramalmgreni </em>Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt, 1992 with branchiae from chaetiger 12 and <em>A. digitatus</em> <em> </em>Hartman, 1967 with branchiae from chaetiger 7. Of these, <em>A. posterobranchus, </em>and <em>A. digitatus also </em>possess enlarged superior lobe above notopodia as does Falkland Is. specimen (this lobe is also present, but rudimentary in <em>A. paramalmgreni </em>and <em>A. groenlandiae, </em>while abse<em>nt </em>in <em>A. erectanoides)</em>. <em>Aglaophamus digitatus </em>also<em> </em>shares foliose form of dorsal cirrus, which appears to be much smaller than in Falkland Island specimens, and protrudes well beyond any other lobe associated with notopodia. Further differences lie in the shape of prostomium, which is very narrow and elongated and in presence of small conical protuberance in notopodia.

<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Voucher is a single specimen collected, complete specimen in good condition; small, slender species; 8.5mm long and 0.3mm wide for 65 chaetigers; body in alcohol pale yellow, integument smooth.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Prostomium pentagonal bearing three antennae and two palps.<strong> </strong>Palps distinctly longer than prostomium, broadly triangular lobes, basally free from each other.<strong> </strong>Antennae long, thin, distinctly articulated, positioned anteriorly to eyes; lateral antennae slightly shorter (with around 25 articulations) than median antenna.<strong> </strong>Eyes present, 2 pairs, reddish, very small.<strong> </strong>Pharyngeal tube extending through 8 chaetigers, proventricle with small muscle rings extending through chaetigers 9-17, partially extended with single dorsal tooth positioned near anterior margin of pharynx. First segment achaetous laterally with a pair of long, slender, distinctly articulated tentacular cirri (similar to antenna).</p>
<p>Parapodia uniramous;<strong> </strong>with short, slender, distinctly articulated dorsal cirri, similar to tentacular cirri and antennae, but much shorter, of alternating lengths, longer ones with about 15 and shorter ones with around 10 articulations; ventral cirri only weakly articulated, slender, just about reaching the tip parapodia, inserted medially. In mid-body chaetiger parapodia with 2 aciculae (not protruding) through integument, one with spatula-like tip, and another with subdistally bulge and tapering tip.</p>
<p>Chaetae all compound falcigers, about 12 per fascicle; with varying length of blades (but no true spinigers), distally bidentate with curved tip and serrated margins. Pygidium rounded lobe with 2 very long, weakly articulated lateral cirri.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> Although FI specimen is in a good condition, assigning it to a named species is difficult due to taxonomic complexities of the species rich genus <em>Syllis </em>and resulting confusion of taxonomic reports. Revision of <em>Syllis</em> species from the region will be necessary, including clarification of reports of Northern European species reported from the area.</p>

<p>Several species in genus <em>Jasmineira</em> were collected from Falkland Islands in this study and these are summarised in table below as well as comparative image of staining patterns. These cannot be unambiguously assigned to the species previously reported from the area, mostly due to limitations of existing descriptions and the fact that branchial crowns are often missing. Further, <em>Jasmineira</em> sp. 2, <em>Jasmineira</em> sp. 3 and <em>J. </em>cf. <em>regularis</em> (itself having 2 forms) are very similar to each other, mostly differing in number of radiolar pairs (where possible to establish or at least estimate from abscission zone), number of abdominal segments and body shape of posterior end and pygidium as well as Methyl Green staining patterns. Additionally two more <em>Jasmineira</em> species with number of abdominal segments greater than 30 were distinguished <em>Jasmineira</em> sp. 1 with lateral incision on collar (not detected in other species collected here or reported in literature available on species known from the area) and <em>Jasmineira</em> sp. 4, which differs in its body shape, with segments having shallow, but distinct constrictions given them somewhat bead-like appearance. Of the species known from the area (see table below) only <em>Jasmineira crumenifera</em> Hartmann-Schröder, 1986 has over 30 abdominal segments, however it is unclear which (if any) of the specimens encountered here belong to this species and examination of the holotype is required.</p>

<p><strong><em>Aglaophamus sp. 3</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>HERO: station 1MFA; VINSON WEST: station 1MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Small sized species; both vouchers incomplete, the largest voucher 2.2-2.4 mm long and 0.5mm wide for 16 and 20 chaetiger long fragments. Prostomium pentagonal, slightly longer than wide, with a V-shaped posterior margin, extending over the first chaetiger; a pair of inconspicuous nuchal organs near the posterior corners of prostomium; a pair conical antennae (short, but longer than in other species) in the anterior corners of the prostomium and a pair of palps inserted posteriorly on ventrum the prostomium. Proboscis not everted. Very small branchiae appear from chaetiger 15 (not found in 16 chaetiger long fragment); very small.</p>
<p>Parapodia biramous; sharply conical, unadorned, without any enlarged lobes present. Dorsal cirri very small, digiform in all chaetigers; ventral cirri similar to dorsal cirri. Preacicular chaetae stout, cross-barred in both rami. Postacicular chaetae long, spinulose in both rami. Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong> Several <em>Aglaophamus</em> species with<strong> </strong>the late start of<strong> </strong>branchiae and relatively simple, unadorned parapodia are known from the region similar to the Falkland Island specimens. <em>A. erectanoides</em> Hartmann-Schröder, 1965 branchiae appear from chaetigers 8-10,<strong> </strong><em>A. posterobranchus</em> Hartman, 1967 where branchiae start between chaetigers 9-16 (mostly 12), <em>A. groenlandiae</em> Hartman, 1967 with branchiae from chaetiger 12, <em>A. paramalmgreni </em>Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt, 1992 with branchiae from chaetiger 12 and <em>A. digitatus</em> <em> </em>Hartman, 1967 with branchiae from chaetiger 7. Of these<em>, A. posterobranchus</em>, and A. <em>digitat</em>us possess enlarged superior lobe above notopodia. This lobe is also present, but rudimentary in <em>A. paramalmgreni</em> and <em>A. groenlandiae</em>, while absent in <em>A. erectanoides</em>. No such lobes were observed in Falkland Island specimens (although only short fragments are available for examination, these lobes are generally best developed in anterior and mid body chaetigers). Falkland Island specimen further differ from <em>A. erectanoides</em> in more posterior start of branchiae (from chaetiger 15 as opposed to 8-10<em>)</em>. At present we cannot assign Falkland Island morphotypes unambiguously to any species known from the area and further work will be necessary to establish if these represent a new species. Given their very small size we cannot exclude the possibility that these are juveniles.</p>

<p>Prostomium trapezoidal to pentagonal; 2 pairs of eyes in trapezoid arrangement, anterior pair large cup-shaped, posterior pair smaller spherical. Palps broad, rounded folded downwards, fused basally. Three pairs of antenna, all styles missing, scars observable upon staining. Pharynx extends through 7 or 8 chaetigers; everted pharynx with large, single, dorsal tooth located on anterior margin of pharynx, opening surrounded by a crown of 10 soft papillae. Proventricule extends through approximately 10 chaetigers from chaetiger 7/8 to 16/17. Peristomium dorsally reduced, covered by first chaetiger; with a pair of tentacular cirri, long, slender, weakly articulated.</p>
<p>Parapodia uniramous; dorsal cirri mostly missing, where present, long, slender, weakly articulated (but not forming true articles) alternating in length; ventral cirri short and broad, ovate.</p>
<p>Chaetae all compound in 20 chaetigers, all located ventral to single, straight, blunt-tip acicula; directly ventral to acicula 2 slender spinigers, with very long slender blades, distally distinctly bi-dentate, margin with short serrations; other chaetae about 12 falcigers with varying length of blades (length decreasing ventrally), blades rather wide, with distinctly serrated margin, distally bidentate; simple chaetae not observed in 20 chaetigers. Pygidium unknown.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>This specimen belongs to genus <em>Pionosyllis</em> (or possible to other closely related genera, see San Martin et al. 2009 for details). Of the previously reported species from the geographical area of interest here, FI specimens show affinities with <em>Pionosyllis </em>cf. <em>ehlersiaeformis</em> Augener, 1913 recorded from the area by Hartmann-Schröder and <em>Paraehlersia dionisi</em> (Núñez & San Martín, 1991) (<em>Pionosyllis elephantensis</em> Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1992 is considered a junior synonym of this species) , which both possess long spinigers.

<p>Branchial crown missing.</p>
<p>Collar very well-developed, much higher ventrally than dorsally; with smooth anterior margin; ventrally with an obvious mid-ventral notch; dorsally median lobes not overlapping, separated by a small gap.</p>

<p>Collar chaetae narrowly-hooded arranged in oblique rows. Following thoracic chaetigers with 3 types of chaetae (arrangement as observed in anterior thoracic chaetigers): 1. long, narrowly-hooded chaetae, about 3 per fascicle; 2. paleate (mucronate) chaetae of various lengths, about 4 per fascicle; 3. very short, broadly limbate chaetae, 3 per fascicle. Thoracic neuropodial uncini acicular, with several rows of minute, similar-sized teeth covering half the length of main fang; reducing in number from chaetiger 2 with 5 uncini to 2 uncini in chaetiger 8 (the last thoracic chaetiger). Companion chaetae absent.</p>
<p>Abdominal chaetigers with few (4 in anterior abdomen, reduced to 3 in mid and 1 in posterior abdomen); elongate, narrowly-limbate (hooded) chaetae. Abdominal uncini avicular (S-shaped), elongated, with reduced breast; up to 4 arranged in a single row in chaetiger 9 (first abdominal chaetiger), diminishing number posteriorly to 1 in the last abdominal chaetiger; with several rows of similar-sized teeth, occupying half the length of main fang.</p>
<p>Posteriomost chaetigers wide, narrowing abruptly into wider than long pygidial lobe with vey slender, short cirrus; pygidial eyespots not observed. Tube not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Several species in genus <em>Jasmineira</em> were collected from Falkland Islands in this study and these are summarised in the table on the genus page. All of these species had typical <em>Jasmineira</em>-like abscission zone, when branchial crown was missing, feature not observed in this specimen. It is difficult to assign this species accurately to a genus as key features of the branchial crown are missing and the specimens are so small. So this small species may also belong to genus <em>Claviramus</em> (of which example was also collected from Falkland Is. in this study). <em>Jasmineira </em>sp. 5 can be easily distinguished from other <em>Jasmineira</em> species (with the exception of <em>Jasmineira </em>sp. 6) by its very small size and low number of abdominal chaetigers. However the species can be easily overlooked or assumed to be a juvenile. Even though the species is very small, detail of chaetae could have been observed with relative ease in comparison to much larger species. A very similar morphospecies <em>Jasmineira</em> sp. 6 has also been collected; two species differ in staining pattern, form of pygidium and presence or absence of abscission zone, when branchial crown is missing (see details under entry <em>Jasmineira</em> sp. 6).</p>

<p><strong><em>Anguillosyllis palpata</em> (Hartman, 1967)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>INFLEX: station 2MFB and VINSON WEST: station 5MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Small species, with distinctly long palps; robust body, dorsoventrally flattened, widest in middle tapering both anteriorly and posteriorly; 1.3-2.3mm long, 0.3-0.4mm wide; with 11 chaetigers; integument smooth. Proboscis not everted.</p>
<p>Prostomium slightly wider than long, with three short, smooth antennae of subequal length; eyes absent. Long, narrow palps fused for at least half their length. First segment with one pair of smooth, short digiform tentacular cirri.</p>
<p>Parapodia very long, cylindrical, uniramous. Dorsal cirri extremely long, thin and coiled, appear smooth, but very long weak articles detected under high magnification; present on all parapodia. Ventral cirri digitiform, inserted near distal end of parapodia.</p>
<p>Chaetigers with numerous unidentate, compound chaetae with differing lengths of blades decreasing inferiorly, shape of blades changes from pseudospinigers with wide, shallow serrations to shorter knife-like falcigers with distinct serration of margin within each bundle. Pygidium preceded by 2 pre-anal, achaetous rings, pygidium short bulbous, no cirri observed (likely broken off).</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>This species corresponds well with the descriptions of <em>Anguillosyllis palpata </em>(see Hartman, 1967; Aguado and San Martín, 2008; Bögemann, 2009 for details) described from Southern Ocean, Drake Passage, off Cape Horn, Angola, Cape and Guinea Basins and found in bathyal and abyssal depths. Bögemann (2009) commented on great similarity of this species with South African <em>Anguillosyllis capensis</em> Day 1963, suggesting these may be conspecifics. Molecular evidence (Böggemann, 2009) suggests that abyssal specimens of <em>A. capensis</em> from SE Atlantic basins represent in fact three different species.</p>

<p><strong><em>Jasmineira </em>cf. <em>regularis</em> Hartman, 1978 (form 1)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher specimens. </strong>Sea Lion: station 79MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Small sized species; voucher complete (including branchial crown), 6mm long plus 3mm for crown and 0.4mm wide; 8 thoracic and 24 abdominal chaetigers; chaetigers never bead-like, always longer than wide, crowded posteriorly; colour in alcohol pale yellow.</p>
<p>Branchial crown with 5 pairs of radioles; with 2 pairs of non-vascularised ventral radiolar appendages, about half the length of radioles; where missing, branchial crown with a typical <em>Jasmineira</em>-abscission zone.</p>
<p>Collar is well-developed, higher ventrally than dorsally, with smooth anterior margin, and ventrally with an obvious mid-ventral notch less than half the length of collar; dorsally forming two pockets separated by a median gap.</p>
<p>Narrow glandular ridge around chaetiger 2.</p>
<p>Collar chaetae narrowly-hooded arranged in oblique rows. Following thoracic chaetigers with narrowly-hooded superior chaetae, about 3 per fascicle and paleate inferior chaetae with long mucron, about 5 per fascicle. Thoracic neuropodial uncini acicular, with several rows of minute, similar-sized teeth covering half the length of main fang; reducing in number from chaetiger 2 with 8 uncini in a row to 4 in chaetiger 8 (the last thoracic chaetiger). Companion chaetae absent. Abdominal chaetigers with few elongate, narrowly-limbate (hooded) chaetae. Abdominal uncini avicular (S-shaped), elongated, about 7 arranged in a single row in chaetigers 9 (first abdominal chaetiger), diminishing number posteriorly to 2 in the last abdominal chaetiger; with five rows of similar-sized teeth, occupying half the length of main fang; reduced breast and medium-length handle.</p>
<p>Posteriomost chaetigers gradually narrowing into blunt triangular pygidial lobe; pygidial eyespots not observed. Tube not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Several species in genus <em>Jasmineira</em> were collected from Falkland Islands in this study and these are summarised in table below as well as comparative image of staining patterns. These cannot be unambiguously assigned to the species previously reported from the area, mostly due to limitations of existing descriptions and the fact that branchial crowns are often missing. Specimens with 24-28 abdominal chaetigers and 5 pairs of radioles (and as additionally observed 2 pairs of nonvascularised ventral radiolar appendages) when branchial crown attached, or 7 scars observed on abscission zone where branchial crown missing, were intially assigned to <em>Jasmineira regularis</em> as these correspond well with the original description Hartman (1978). However, eventually two forms emerged among these specimens with different shape of posterior end and some differences in staining patterns (see comparative table and comparative images).</p>
<p>Further, <em>Jasmineira</em> sp. 2, <em>Jasmineira</em> sp. 3 and <em>J. </em>cf. <em>regularis</em> (itself having 2 forms) are very similar to each other, mostly differing in number of radiolar pairs (where possible to establish or at least estimate from abscission zone), number of abdominal segments and body shape of posterior end and pygidium as well as methyl green patterns. Additionally two more <em>Jasmineira</em> species with number of abdominal segments greater than 30 were distinguished <em>Jasmineira</em> sp. 1 with lateral as well as ventral incisions on collar and <em>Jasmineira</em> sp. 4, which differs in its body shape, with segments having shallow, but distinct constrictions giving them somewhat bead-like appearance. Of the species known from the area (see table below) only <em>Jasmineira crumenifera</em> Hartmann-Schröder, 1986 has over 30 abdominal segments, however it is unclear which (if any) of the specimens encountered here belong to this species and examination of the holotype is required.</p>

<p><strong><em>Aglaophamus </em> cf. <em>peruana </em>Hartman, 1940 </strong></p>
<p><strong>Vouchers. </strong>VINSON WEST: station 2 MFB; LOLIGO: station L14FA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Medium sized species represented by two complete (even if fragmented) specimens; 26mm long and 2.2mm wide for 65 chaetigers and 41mm long and 3mm wide for 75 chaetigers.</p>
<p>Prostomium subspherical, about as wide as long, with a V-shaped posterior margin, extending over the first chaetiger; a pair of nuchal organs clearly visible near the posterior corners of prostomium; a pair of conical antennae in the anterior corners of the prostomium and a pair of palps inserted posteriorly on ventrum the prostomium. Proboscis not everted. Inter-ramal cirri involute; from chaetiger 3 where rudimentary (easily overlooked, revealed by Shirlastain); slender throughout, progressively increasing in size up to mid body then decreasing in size posteriorly, eventually absent from the last 5 chaetigers. Parapodia biramous; complex with enlarged foliose postchaetal lobes in both rami (refer to the image for details). Dorsal cirri small, conical in chaetiger 1; from chaetiger 2 foliose, round, distally abruptly produced into shapely, slender tip; increasing in size till mid body then decreasing in size posteriorly, becoming very small and assuming nearly conical shape in the last 5 chaetigers. Ventral cirri particularly well developed in chaetiger 1, where bulbous with wide base and slender distally; well developed in other chaetigers, assuming more slender skittle-shaped to cirriform form; becoming very small digiform in posterior chaetigers. Preacicular chaetae cross-barred; postacicular chaetae spinulose along most of its shaft and single aciculae light yellow in colour, similar throughout the body length. Pygidium as terminal, blunt conical lobe.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Specimens assigned here to<strong> </strong><em>Aglaophamus </em>cf.<em> peruana</em> agree with Hartmans (1940) species particularly in that tiny branchiae detected from chaetiger 3 and both specimens posses various enlarged lobes and foliose dorsal cirrus. There are possibly some differences in the shapes of various lobes (Hartmans description is rather brief, but accompanied by drawings) and direct comparison with the holotype would be necessary to determine this. Falkland Islands specimen in fact show similarity to two other species with enlarged foliose lobes known from the region - <em>Aglaophamus trissophyllus</em> and <em>Aglaophamus foliosus</em>. <em>Aglaophamus trissophyllus</em> (known for reaching very large size) has a confused taxonomic history. It was originally described by Grube (1877) from the Kerguelen Is, while Hartman (1967) described <em>A. ornatus</em> from the deep Bransfield Straits, which was later synonimized with <em>A. trissophyllus</em>. Hartman (1967) also described another similar species as <em>Aglaophamus foliosus</em>, from deep-water (S. Sandwich Is. in 1482m and Cape Horn 1906-2013m) and questionably from Falkland Is. in 578m. Examination of non-type material of <em>A. trissophyllus </em>collected from Kerguelen Is. (type locality of Grubes <em>A. trissophyllus</em>) available at NHM collection was undertaken to draw comparisons with Falkland Is. specimens and <em>A. folisosus</em> (based on Hartmans description and images). These observations were summarized in table below; for images of parapodia refer to comparative figure. Further work, accompanied by molecular studies will be necessary to fully resolve the status of Falkland Islands specimens collected here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Exogone </em> cf. <em> heterosetosa </em> McIntosh, 1885 </strong></p>
<p><strong>Vouchers. </strong> Sea Lion: station 7MFC.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong> Voucher is a complete specimen; very small, slender species; 2.8mm long, 0.25mm wide for 33 chaetigers. Integument smooth; colour in alcohol pale yellow.</p>
<p>Prostomium about twice as wide as long bearing three antennae and two palps. Palps about as long as prostomium; fused throughout their length. Antennae smooth, arising nearly at same level, positioned anterior to eyes; antennae spindle-shaped with median antenna slightly longer than lateral ones. Two pairs of large red eyes present, positioned close together, anterior pair large, cup-shaped, posterior pair smaller, spherical. Pharyngeal tube extending through 3 chaetigers; proventricle extending through chaetigers 3-6. First segment achaetous laterally with a pair of smooth, very short, rounded tentacular cirri.</p>
<p>Parapodia uniramous, short but distinct. Dorsal cirri missing on chaetiger 2, otherwise present, smooth ovoid, dorsal cirri; ventral cirri smaller than dorsal cirri, ovoid, inserted near parapodial base.</p>
<p>Chaetae of several different types, up to 6 per fascicle in mid segments, arranged in the following way (dorso-ventrally): type 1 one, simple, bidentate upper (dorsal) chaeta, long, distally expanded with distinct serration; type 2 one modified compound falciger, with expanded serrated joint, distally bidentate with very slender secondary tooth, short blade with margin distinctly serrated; type 3 three compound falciger, smaller and less developed than type 2, with small, serrated joint and short, distally bidentate blade with slender secondary tooth, margin serrated; type 4 one, simple, bidentate lower (ventral) chaeta, long, slender distally tapering into blunt, smooth tip; both simple chaetae lacking in anteriormost chaetigers. Pygidium damaged.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong> This species is very similar to <em> Exogone heterosetosa </em> McIntosh, 1885 <em> </em> described from the Southern Ocean<em>, </em> off Marion Island and commonly recorded from the geographical area of interest here (see Hartman, 1966 for details), but it is clearly beset with many taxonomic problems. McIntosh's (1885) description is relatively brief and appears to be based on a specimen with damaged median antenna, which has led to subsequent misinterpretation of this species. Several other species were eventually synonymised with <em> E. heterosetosa, </em><em>E. turqueti </em> Gravier, 1906; <em> E. heterochaeta </em> Augener, 1913; <em> E. clavator </em> Ehlers, 1913; <em> E. anomalochaeta </em> Benham, 1921 but it is not clear if this synonymy has always been justified. In our opinion the drawings of chaetae (see image below) by McIntosh (1885) of holotype of <em> E. heterosetosa </em> , by Benham (1927) <em> of E. anomalochaeta </em> Benham, 1921 and those of <em> E. clavator </em> by Ehlers (1913) represent different species, with different developments of modified compound chaeta and neither of which correspond to the Falkland specimens. Ehlers species is in fact very similar to <em> Exogone heterosetoides australis </em> Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1988 (as it possesses longer median antenna and long, robust spiniger-like modified compound chaeta), which has also been recoded from Falkland Islands in this study (see separate entry).</p>
<p>In recent times, San Martin (2005) provided description of <em> E. heterosetosa </em> (which he considered identical to <em> E. heterosetoides australis</em>) based on Australian material and relying on non-type material of Haswell (1920) commented: <em> The Australian specimens agree with Haswells (1920a) description of E. heterosetosa; the original description did not specify the length of the median antenna, because the state of the preparation renders its presence doubtful (McIntosh, 1885); subsequent descriptions of the species, however, show a long median antenna</em>. The original description by Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt, 1988 stated that median antenna is 3 times longer than lateral ones. In our opinion the species with long antenna belongs to <em> E. heterosetoides australis </em> rather than <em> E. heterosetosa </em> and the two are distinct species. Confusion cannot be clarified without a full revision of both species, but it is very likely that several species were in fact lumped under each name and both species were in turn mistaken for each other. It appears that the development of modified compound chaeta (ranging from short falciger-like to long or extremely long spiniger-like blade) and at which segment these appear in the body is of taxonomic importance, but has not been paid much attention to in the past.</p>
<p>In summary, Falkland Island specimens assigned to <em> Exogone </em> cf. <em> heterosetosa </em> possess short median antenna and modified compound chaeta essentially falciger-like, with short blade. Similar species encountered in this study with long median antenna and modified compound chaetae clearly spiniger-like with long blade is assigned to <em> Exogone heterosetoides australis </em> .</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Small sized species; voucher with complete (branchial crown missing), 9 mm long (body only) and 0.6 mm wide; 8 thoracic and 28 abdominal chaetigers (variation of 26-28 observed in other specimens); chaetigers never bead-like, always longer than wide, crowded posteriorly; colour in alcohol pale yellow.</p>

<p>Narrow glandular ridge around chaetiger 2.</p>
<p>Collar chaetae narrowly-hooded arranged in oblique rows.

Companion chaetae absent. Abdominal chaetigers with few elongate, narrowly-limbate (hooded) chaetae. Abdominal uncini avicular (S-shaped), elongated, about 7 arranged in a single row in chaetigers 9 (first abdominal chaetiger), diminishing number posteriorly to 2 in the last abdominal chaetiger; with five rows of similar-sized teeth, occupying half the length of main fang; reduced breast and medium-length handle .</p>

<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Several species in genus <em>Jasmineira</em> were collected from Falkland Islands in this study and these are summarised in table below as well as comparative image of staining patterns. These cannot be unambiguously assigned to the species previously reported from the area, mostly due to limitations of existing descriptions and the fact that branchial crowns are often missing. Specimens with 24-28 abdominal chaetigers and 5 pairs of radioles (and as additionally observed 2 pairs of nonvascularised ventral radiolar appendages) when branchial crown attached, or 7 scars observed on abscission zone where branchial crown missing, where intial assigned to <em>Jasmineira regularis</em> as these correspond well with the original description Hartman (1978). However, eventually two forms emerged among these specimens with different shape of posterior end and some differences in staining patterns (see comparative table and comparative images).</p>
<p>Further, <em>Jasmineira</em> sp. 2, <em>Jasmineira</em> sp. 3 and <em>J. </em>cf. <em>regularis</em> (itself having 2 forms) are very similar to each other, mostly differing in number of radiolar pairs (where possible to establish or at least estimate from abscission zone), number of abdominal segments and body shape of posterior end and pygidium as well as methyl green patterns. Additionally two more <em>Jasmineira</em> species with number of abdominal segments greater than 30 were distinguished <em>Jasmineira</em> sp. 1 with lateral as well as ventral incisions on collar and <em>Jasmineira</em> sp. 4, which differs in its body shape, with segments having shallow, but distinct constrictions given them somewhat bead-like appearance. Of the species known from the area (see table below) only <em>Jasmineira crumenifera</em> Hartmann-Schröder, 1986 has over 30 abdominal segments, however it is unclear which (if any) of the specimens encountered here belong to this species and examination of the holotype is required.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>INFLEX: station 5MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Small sized species; voucher incomplete (in two fragments), 29mm long and 2.8mm wide for 53 chaetiger long fragment.</p>
<p>Prostomium somewhat ovate, longer than wide, with a V-shaped posterior margin, extending over the first chaetiger; a pair of nuchal organs near the posterior corners of prostomium; a pair of conical antennae in the anterior corners of the prostomium and a pair of palps inserted posteriorly on ventrum the prostomium. Proboscis not everted. Branchiae (inter-ramal cirri) involute; appearing from chaetiger 9, where very small; getting progressively large, but not very coiled (only distally curved inwards); present until end of 53 chaetiger long fragment, where very small again. Parapodia biramous; unadorned - no particularly enlarged lobes present, with the exception of superior lobe over notopodia, which is erect and enlarged (refer to the image for details). Dorsal cirri small, conical in chaetiger 1; from chaetiger 2 small, conical to slightly oval, similar throughout (refer to the image). Ventral cirri particularly well developed in chaetiger 1, where skittle-shaped (slender, but with wider base and thin distally); small, conical in other chaetigers. Preacicular chaetae stout, short, cross-barred in distal half of the shaft; of the same form in both rami. Postacicular chaetae long (particularly long in neuropodia), stouter spinulose and slender (appearing) smooth chaetae present. Single acicular present in each ramus, acicular with very long, thin tip, distally strongly bent. Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Of several <em>Aglaophamus</em> species with<strong> </strong>the late start of<strong> </strong>branchiae and relatively simple, unadorned parapodia known from the region, the Falkland Island specimen corresponds well to <em>A. posterobranchus </em>(see aslo remarks under <em>Aglaophamus</em> sp. 2 and <em>A. </em>sp. 3)<em>. </em>It agrees in the size of specimen, origin of branchiae, shape of prostomium, form of dorsal and ventral cirri and shape of parapodia with rudimentary preacicular lobes in both rami, sharply conical acicular lobes in both rami and presence of superior lobe over notopodia, which is erect and enlarged, even in posterior chaetigers (in 53 chaetigers long fragment). Hartman (1967) reported that branchiae may start from chaetiger 9-13 (most commonly 12) and in some specimens not before chaetiger 16. This variation seems to encompass variation encountered in <em>Aglaophamus</em> specimens collected from Falklands Islands, but upon more thorough examination, some of these were assigned to different morphospecies. <em>Aglaophamus</em> sp. 2 is the most similar to specimen assigned here to <em>A. posterobranchus</em>, but its notopodial cirrus is more developed and of foliose form. <em>Aglaophamus</em> sp. 3 with branchiae from chaetiger 15 or not present in 16 chaetiger long fragment lacked the erect, enlarged lobe above notopodia, which is clearly present (even in anterior chaetigers) in specimen assigned here to <em>A. posterobranchus</em> and reported by Hartman (1967) in holotype. Both <em>Aglaophamus</em> sp. 2 and 3 are represented by very small specimens (2.2-3mm long in <20 chaetigers long fragments) and it is possible that these represent developmental stages. Future molecular studies will be necessary to resolve this problem.</p>

<p><strong>Vouchers. </strong>VINSON WEST: station 1MFB (best condition) and station 38MFB<strong> </strong>(all antennae missing) NIMROD: station N12FB (lateral antennae missing), INFLEX: 1MFA (median antenna missing).</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Vouchers to some extent damaged, with only voucher VINSON WEST, station 1MFB in good condition; the following diagnosis based on this specimen. Complete specimen; very small, fragile, slender species; 4mm long, 0.2 mm wide for 39 chaetigers. Integument smooth; colour in alcohol pale yellow.</p>
<p>Prostomium about twice as wide as long bearing three antennae and two palps. Palps about as long as prostomium; fused throughout their length. Antennae smooth, arising nearly at same level, positioned anterior to eyes; lateral antennae short, spindle-shaped; median antenna longest, about three times the length of the lateral ones, cirriform. Two pairs of distinct red eyes present, positioned close together, anterior pair large, cup-shaped, posterior pair smaller, spherical. Pharyngeal tube extending through 2 chaetigers, proventricle extending through chaetigers 3-5. First segment achaetous laterally with a pair of smooth, very short, rounded tentacular cirri.</p>
<p>Parapodia uniramous, short but distinct. Dorsal cirri missing on chaetiger 2, otherwise present, smooth ovoid, dorsal cirri; ventral cirri smaller than dorsal cirri, ovoid, inserted near parapodial base.</p>
<p>Chaetae of several different types, up to 6 per fascicle in mid segments, arranged in the following way (dorso-ventrally): type 1 one, simple, bidentate upper (dorsal) chaeta, long, distally expanded with distinct serration; type 2 one large compound spiniger, with expanded serrated joint and long, smooth, extremely thin blade, which may be distally minutely bidentate (tip often twisted, or folded over and difficult to observe with certainty); type 3 two to three compound falciger with short, bidentate; 4 one, simple, bidentate lower (ventral) chaeta, long, slender distally tapering into blunt, smooth tip; both simple chaetae present from chaetiger 1. Pygidium, rounded lobes, with long lateral cirri.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>This species corresponds well with <em>Exogone heterosetoides australis</em> (see Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1988 for details) described from Southern Ocean, Antarctic Peninsula (near Arctowski Polish Research Station, King George Island). The specimens differ in their development of antennae (completely missing in one voucher) and may therefore represent different regenerative stages, however in the best preserved specimen median antenna is about three times the length of the lateral ones as in description of holotype given by Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt (1988). Confusion with similar species <em>Exogone heterosetosa</em> (see separate entry and remarks under the species name <em>Exogone</em> cf. <em>heterosetosa</em>) likely happened in the past and it is possible that several species were lumped under the name <em>Exogone heterosetosa</em>, partially given by the lack of clarity on the length of median antenna in McIntosh's holotype. Also in<em> E. heterosetosa </em>reported in this study (see separate entry) the modified compound chaetae is more of a falcigerous form with short blade, not an obvious elongated form as described by Schröder & Rosenfeldt (1988) and as observed in FI specimens assigned here to <em>E. heterosetoides australis</em>. Careful re-examination of all material, particularly type material would be necessary to establish if it is in fact composed of several different species.</p>

Ventral cirri particularly well developed in chaetiger 1, where skittle-shaped (slender, but with wider base and thin distally); well developed in other chaetigers, tapering, cirriform.</p>
<p>Preacicular chaetae stout, cross-barred in both rami. Postacicular chaetae in notopodia long, stouter spinulose and these are extremely long in neuropodia, appearing silky (shining and silvery). Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong>. This<em> Aglaophamus</em> species has very long postacicular chaetae in neuropodia, with silky appearance. Of the known species of <em>Aglaophamus</em> known from the area, it is most similar to <em>A. digitatus</em> Hartman, 1967 in form of parapodia sharply conical acicular lobes, enlarged lobes above notopodia and importantly the presence of small conical protuberance on neuropodia. Two species differ in the shape of prostomium (very narrow and elongated in <em>A. digitatus</em>), start of the branchiae (from chaetiger 7, not 4 in <em>A. digitatus</em>) and form of dorsal cirrus (foliose, not cirriform in <em>A. digitatus</em>). This specimen likely represent a new species, however greater number of specimens and observation of proboscis will be necessary to fully diagnose this species.</p>

<p><strong><em>Jasmineira </em>sp. 6</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher specimens. </strong>Sea Lion: station 43MFC.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Extremely small sized species; voucher with body complete (branchial crown missing); 2.2mm long (body) and 0.3mm wide; 8 thoracic and 10 abdominal chaetigers.</p>
<p>Branchial crown missing; with a typical <em>Jasmineira</em>-abscission zone.</p>
<p>Collar very well-developed, much higher ventrally than dorsally; with smooth anterior margin; ventrally with an obvious mid-ventral notch; dorsally median lobes not overlapping, separated by a small gap.</p>
<p>Narrow glandular ridge around chaetiger 2.</p>
<p>Collar chaetae limbate (hooded) arranged in oblique rows. Thoracic chaetigers with long, narrowly-limbate superior chaetae, slightly shorter mucronate inferior chaetae with very long slender mucron and very short broadly hooded chaetae; 3+4+3 arrangement per fascicle observed in anterior chaetigers. Thoracic neuropodial uncini acicular, with several rows of minute, similar-sized teeth covering half the length of main fang; reducing in number from chaetiger 2 with 4 uncini to 1 uncinus in chaetiger 8 (the last thoracic chaetiger). Companion chaetae absent.</p>
<p>Abdominal chaetigers with few neurochaetae (4 in anterior abdomen, reduced to 3 in posterior, with 2 chaetae in last abdominal unciniger); elongate, narrowly-limbate (hooded), some longer, some shorter. Abdominal uncini avicular (S-shaped), elongated, with reduced breast; up to 4 arranged in a single row in chaetiger 9 (first abdominal chaetiger), diminishing number posteriorly to 2 in the last abdominal chaetiger; with several rows of similar-sized teeth, occupying half the length of main fang.</p>
<p>Posteriomost chaetigers narrowing gradually into fleshy, triangular pygidial lobe without any cirri; pygidial eyespots not observed. Tube not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Methyl Green pattern:</strong> refer to image.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Several species in genus <em>Jasmineira</em> were collected from Falkland Islands in this study and these are summarised in the table on the <em>Jasmineira </em>page. <em>Jasmineira </em>sp. 6 can be easily distinguished from the other species by its very small size and low number of abdominal chaetigers (n=10). However, another very similar species, with currently unresolved identification possibly belonging to genus <em>Jasmineira or Claviramus </em>was also collected from Falkland Is<em>. </em>This species <em>Jasmineira? (Claviramus?) </em>sp. 5 is of similar size and also possesses 10 abdominal chaetigers, but it lacks the obvious <em>Jasmineira</em>- abscission zone of branchial crown, its pygidium is broader and shorter, bearing a short, slender terminal cirrus. The two species also differ markedly in their Methyl Green staining pattern particularly when observed within minutes to hours of staining (refer to comparative image), the pattern somewhat converged after several days, but are not identical (refer to comparative image). Of the known species of <em>Jasmineira</em> from the area, <em>J. macrophthalma</em> Ehlers, 1913 also possess only 10-12 abdominal segments (no drawings were provided with the original description). However Ehlers stated that description is based on two slightly different forms (from two different locations - Kerguelen Islands and Wilhelm II Coast) and, therefore, it needs to be clarified if these were in fact different species. Both of his specimens had eyes (forming brown pigmented, crescent-shaped patch) according to Ehlers, which were not observed in Falkland Is. specimens.</p>

<p><strong><em>Nephtys </em></strong>cf. <strong><em>paradoxa</em> Malmgren, 1874</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>SEA LION: station 53MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Large species, voucher is the only example of this species collected; complete specimen, about 65mm long and 5mm wide (including parapodia); posteriorly body segments very deeply incised and narrow, assuming shape of bellows of accordion. Prostomium not clearly observed due to partially everted pharynx. Pharynx only partially everted, proximal part smooth, without warts, not wrinkled; distal part not fully observed: distal region with 10 pairs of terminal bifid papillae, subdistal region about 20 rows of conical papillae (number of these per row not established). Jaws not examined. Inter-ramal cirri recurved; from chaetiger 14 where rudimentary, assuming enlarged foliose shape soon after, progressively increasing in size up to chaetiger 37; from chaetiger 38 foliose appearance lost, branchiae as triangular, fleshy lobe, decreasing in size posteriorly, eventually absent from around chaetiger 55. Parapodia unadorned without enlarged lobes; acicular lobes rounded with a conical tip; pre- and postchaetal lobes short; dorsal cirri small, conical; ventral cirri small, conical (refer to images of parapodia for details). Preacicular chaetae cross-barred; postacicular chaetae basally spinulose (otherwise smooth) in anterior parapodia, becoming more stout (often broken off) in posterior parapodia; chaetae and single aciculae amber in colour, chaetae of posterior chaetigers darker in colour. Pygidium present but damaged; a single achateous ring with dorsal annulated fleshy lobe.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>The characters observed in specimens collected from FI agree well with<strong> </strong><em>Nephtys paradoxa</em> Malm, 1874 (type locality from Northern Europe Koster, Bohuslän, Sweden), which has been recently re-described by Ravara et al. (2010). Currently, it is considered cosmopolitan and there is a need for molecular analysis to resolve its status (see comments in Ravara et al., 2010 for details).

<p><strong><em>Ancistrosyllis </em>cf. <em>groenlandica </em>McIntosh, 1879</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher.</strong> Sea Lion: station MFC1, TOROA: station T4FA (largest specimen); ENDEAVOUR: station E4FA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> All vouchers incomplete, the largest specimen (TOROA), body wide, dorso-ventrally flattened; 12mm long and 1mm wide (including parapodia), for 42 chaetigers; colour in alcohol dark yellow to light orange, with patches of brown pigment on prostomium and dorsally on first four chaetigers. Integument with numerous small conical papillae, dorsal cirri with conical to goblet-shaped, distally serrated papillae. Prostomium small and inconspicuous with three short conical antennae and two bi-articulate palps. Two antennae inserted medio-laterally and median antenna on the posterior end of the prostomium; antennae of similar size. Palps indistinctly set off from prostomium; palpophores massive, basally slightly fused; palpostyles minute, conical, positioned antero-ventrally. Eyes absent. Proboscis retracted in all specimens. First segment achaetous, about as long as following segments; with two pairs of conical, cirri of similar size, inserted laterally.</p>
<p>Parapodia sub-biramous; notopodia reduced to single acicula; large curved hooks from chaetiger 5 until the end of fragment. Conical dorsal cirri of first chaetiger about twice as long as on following segment, further cirri slightly longer than second one; papillated with large conical to distinctly goblet-shaped, distally serrated papillae. Neuropodial lobes conical, short (tips of dorsal and ventral cirri surpassing it) each with a single acicula. Neurochaetae often broken off, only few observed; upper neurochaetae - laterally compressed, serrated, simple with bidentate tips, up to 5 chaetae of two lengths short and long; lower neurochaetae composed of few chaetae shorter and thicker than chaetae of upper group, spine-like, curved tip appear unidentate (secondary tooth may be broken off). Digitiform, papillated ventral cirri from 1st chaetiger, slightly shorter than dorsal cirri. Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Of the known species of<strong> </strong><em>Ancistrosyllis</em><strong> </strong>Falkland specimens are most similar to <em>A. groenlandica</em>, McIntosh 1879 as ventral cirri begin from chaetiger 1 and dorsal hooks from chaetiger 5 (range in <em>A. groenlandica</em> is chaetiger 4-6, with chaetiger 5 most common). This species was described from 750m, Arctic Ocean, Greenland, Davis Strait, but since then has been reported from wide geographical and bathymetrical ranges and several authors provided re-description of this species (e.g. Blake, 1994; Böggemann, 2009), the goblet-shaped papillae were not reported before. The holotype of <em>A. groenlandica</em> is housed at NHM London and was re-examined as part of this study. Holotype is not in good condition, slightly desiccated, with most chaetae broken off. No goblet-shaped papillae were found in holotype, but it is not clear if this due to age/condition of the material (but these were not reported by McIntosh). Other differences include some subtle differences in the length of appendages (both specimens compared were of similar size). At present we do not consider these tentative differences sufficient to recognise Falkland specimens as a different species. Fresh material from the type locality as well as molecular evidence are needed to validate the supposed cosmopolitan distribution of <em>A. groenlandica</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Perkinsiana? sp. 2</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>NIMROD: N11FA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Voucher is a complete specimen; small to medium sized species, with 8 thoracic and approximately 52<strong> </strong>abdominal chaetigers; body 9 mm long and 0.8 mm wide, branchial crown 6.5mm long. Thoracic and abdominal chaetigers similar, rather narrow, intersegmentally incised.</p>
<p>Branchial crown with 7 pairs of radioles; radioles lacking pigmentation; with long tips; with many pinnules;<strong> </strong>palmate membrane absent; ventral<strong> </strong>radioles shorter than dorsal ones; the base of the crown high. Radiolar appendages of dorsal lips prominent as long, narrow, lobe; with long, thin pinnular appendage. Collar somewhat oblique, covering the base of the crown; not developed dorsally and with two rounded lappets of medium height ventrally<strong>. </strong></p>
<p>Thoracic notochaetae mostly missing (broken off), superior chaetae not observed , inferior paleate (mucronate) chaetae with short tips observed. Thoracic tori short, not indenting the thoracic ventral shields; thoracic uncini avicular with rounded breasts and likely short handles (handle length not clearly observed, but appear to be no longer then distance between crest and breast); approximately 10 arranged in single row; companion chaetae with a flat and very long tapered blade at right-angles, with several minute teeth. Abdominal neurochaetae long, narrowly limbate, 5 per fascicle; additionally about 2-3 extremely narrow limbate shorter chaetae observed. Abdominal uncini with equally-sized teeth above main fang, covering half the length of the main fang, with long necks, only slightly enlarged breasts and short handles.</p>
<p>Pygidium as rounded lobe; no cirri or pygidial eyes observed. Tube not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>The genus <em>Perkinsiana </em>resembles other genera, particularly <em>Potamilla</em> Malmgren, 1866 and <em>Parasabella</em> Bush, 1905; while <em>Potaspina </em>Hartman, 1969<em> </em>can be distinguished with relative ease by replacement of typical thoracic uncini by acicular spines (Giangrande and Gambi, 1997). Knight-Jones (1983) re-define some of these (i.e. <em>Potamilla </em>lacks well developed radiolar appendages supporting the dorsal lips), while establishing genus <em>Perkinsiana</em>. Even though a clear synapomorphy for this genus is still missing (Rouse 1996, Capa 2007), the length of handle of thoracic uncini and development of hood of abdominal neurochaete has been considered of taxonomic importance. The genus <em>Perkinsiana</em> is particularly diverse in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters and has a confused taxonomic past (good regional summary and key provided by Giandgrande and Gambi, 1997 and more recently updated by Tovar-Hernandez et al. (2012). Falkland Island specimen agrees well and shows similarities with <em>Sabellomma minuta </em>(Treadwell, 1941) (type locality: Atlantic Ocean, Sao Sebastio, Brazil), which was considered to be <em>Perkinsiana</em> by Knight-Jones (1983), they agree in small size, possessing 7 pairs of radioles, around 10 thoracic uncini per ramus each with very short handles and possessing elongated, narrowly limbate abdominal neurochaetae. The new genus <em>Sabellomma</em> Nogueira, Fitzhugh & Rossi, 2010 was however recently established to house this and related species to account for presence of unpaired, simple eyespots along entire lengths of outer radiole margins. These were not observed in Falkland Is. specimen.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Voucher is an incomplete specimen fragmented into three fragments, the largest fragment with prostomium and 19 chaetigers, 12.5mm long and 3mm wide (including parapodia); body dorsally with brown pigmentation.</p>
<p>Prostomium of <em>Harmothoe</em> type bilobed, slightly wider than long, with distinct cephalic peaks, ceratophore of median antenna in anterior notch, lateral antennae inserted ventrally; 2 pairs of eyes - anterior pair of eyes situated dorsolaterally on widest part of prostomium, posterior pair dorsally near hind margin of prostomium.</p>
<p>Outer lateral elytral margin and posterior half of surface with few digitiform papillae; surface covered by conical microtubercules variable, from limited to patch near anterior margin to almost entire surface (pictured).</p>
<p>Parapodia biramous; notochaetae of about same width as neurochaetae; notochaetae with distinct rows of spines and blunt tip; neurochaetae falcate, with rows of spines distally, tip of neurochaetae bidentate with stout secondary tooth, some lower neurochaetae with unidentate tip.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Although voucher specimen is incomplete, it agrees with genus <em>Harmothoe</em> and based on the pattern of elytra agrees well with <em>Harmothoe magellanica</em>. This species, together with other species of genus <em>Harmothoe</em> from the Southern Ocean and Magellan region was recently re-described by Barnich et al. (2006) and we refer readers to this publication for further details.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution: </strong>Magellan Strait, South Patagonia, Kerguelen Islands (type locality), Prince Edward Island, South Georgia, Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and Falkland Islands.</p>

<p><strong><em>Amphicorina </em>sp. 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>VINSON WEST: station 1MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Small, but robust species; voucher specimen with body complete, branchial crown missing; body 2mm long (body only) and 0.5mm wide; with 8 thoracic and 13 abdominal segments.</p>
<p>Collar as an enlarged lobe, wide ventrally, low laterally and dorsally; margin smooth, entire (not notched) ventrally; laterally and dorsally smooth but bent into slight folds; not forming pockets dorsally, not overlapping at dorsal midline; peristomial eye not observed. Glandular ridge on 2 present. </p>
<p>In thorax, mucronate chaetae absent, only limbate (hooded) notochaetae present, about 7 per fascicle; thoracic uncini acicular, up to 8 per fascicle. Abdominal neurochaetae few, narrowly limbate; abdominal uncini rasp-shaped plate, with about 7-8 vertical rows of very small teeth (about 10 per row) above the main fang, up to 9 per ramus,.</p>
<p>Pygidium large triangular lobe, slightly longer then wide; pygidial eyes not observed.</p>
<p>Methyl Green pattern: see image.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Of <em>Amphicorina </em>species known from the area (see Table below),<strong> </strong>FI specimens are most similar to <em>A. kocki</em> (Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt, 1989) described from 68m at Bransfield Straits and <em>A. pulchra</em> from Elephant Is., 134-370m, which both possess similar number of abdominal segments. The specimens agree in terms of its body shape and shape of peristomial collar. However they differ in number and form of abdominal uncini (see comparative table below). The branchial crown is missing in FI specimens and characters derived from this feature cannot be compared. Other species belonging to genus <em>Amphicorina </em>known from the area possess much smaller number of abdominal segments (see comparative table below).</p>

<p><strong><em>Euchone </em>sp. 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher specimens. </strong>VINSON WEST: station 1MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Small bodied, slender species; voucher specimen with body complete, but branchial crown missing; 3 mm long (body) and 0.25 mm wide, with 8 thoracic and 15 abdominal chaetigers with 5 of these associated with pre-pygidial depression; colour in alcohol pale yellow.</p>
<p>Collar well developed, flared; much higher ventrally than dorsally; mid-dorsal margins not overlapping; anterior margin entire without any notches (?). Glandular ridge present on chaetiger 2, very narrow.</p>
<p>Collar chaetae narrowly-limbate arranged in single longitudinal somewhat oblique row; superior notochaetae long, narrowly limbate, while inferior notochaetae short, broadly limbate (but not truly mucronate). Thoracic neuropodial uncini acicular, with main fang relatively slender in lateral view and with at least 6 small teeth. Companion chaetae absent. Abdominal neuropodial chaetae few, narrowly-limbate. Notopodia of anterior abdominal chaetigers with quadrate avicular uncini (not as robust as in other <em>Euchone</em> species); in frontal view resembling rasp-shaped plates of <em>Amphicorin</em>a, with small teeth arranged in about 8 rows of approximately 15 teeth per row above the main fang; with well developed breast and very short handle.</p>
<p>Abdomen with a narrow pre-pygidial depression occupying 5 chaetigers, with high raised membranous lateral flanges connected anteriorly by a rounded membrane, flanges lower posteriorly. Pygidium well developed, triangular lobe. Tube not observed.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks. </strong><em>Euchone </em>sp. 4 shows similarities with <em>Euchone southerni</em>, which has been by now reported from different localities in the Atlantic Ocean - its type locality in Ireland; Gulf of Mexico (as <em>Euchone</em> cf. <em>southerni</em>) and Mediterranean Sea (Giangrande, 1989). This latter species is now considered as a new, but undescribed species (as <em>Euchone</em> sp. in Giangrande and Licciano, 2006). There are detectable differences relating to size, number of abdominal chaetigers, and incision of collar and staining pattern. Falkland Island specimen likely represents a new species; however, specimens with branchial crown (currently not available) will be necessary to fully diagnose this species.</p>

<p><strong><em>Austrolaenilla</em> sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>Sea Lion: station 79MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Voucher is the only example of this species collected, not in good condition; robust, medium sized species; specimen is incomplete, only 10 chaetigers long fragment, 2.5mm and 2mm wide (including parapodia); body yellow to light orange in colour. All elytra missing, total number of elytral pairs unknown.</p>
<p>Prostomium bilobed, rounded (about as wide as long), cephalic peaks not discerned. Palps, smooth, long, tapering. Three antennae present; ceratophore of median antenna large, arising medially on prostomium; lateral antennae inserted ventrally; styles of all antenna long and slender, covered by thin, elongated papillae. Eyes not observed.</p>
<p>Tentacular segment with few notochaetae; two pairs of tentacular cirri, their cirrophores large and cylindrical, their styles similar to those of antennae - thin, papillated, but shorter. Second segment with biramous parapodia, chaetae, pair of elytra and ventrally with very long ventral cirrus (much longer than in subsequent segments) inserted basally and papillated (similar to antennae and tentacular cirri).</p>
<p>Parapodia distinctly biramous; with notopodia smaller than neuropodia; both rami with single, long acicula, extending into very long, thin acicular processes. Cirrigerous segments (those not carrying elytra) with conical dorsal tubercule inserted at the same level as elytrophores (on elytra-carrying segments); cirrophores of dorsally cirri very prominent, inserted medially on notopodia (near fascicle of notochaetae), style of dorsal cirri very long slender, papillated (similar to antennae and tentacular cirri). Ventral cirri, from chatiger 3, short, slender.</p>
<p>Notochaetae numerous, of varying lengths, stout with distinct rows of spines and blunt tip, straw-coloured. Upper and middle neurochaetae strait, slender, very long, with rows of spines sudistally, tips of neurochaetae unidentate and hirsute; lower neurochaetae of different type to upper and middle neurochaetae, shorter, subdistally expanded (falcate) with very faint rows of spines, narrowing into smooth (not hirsute) unidentate tip.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Although the specimen collected here is very incomplete and not in very good condition, the characters observed show differences from <em>A</em>. cf. <em>antarctica</em>, also collected from Falkland Islands (see separate entry). <em>Austrolaenilla</em> sp. 1 has yellow to orange body colour and lower neurochaetae are distinctly different falcate, smooth tip, faint serration on the margin, while <em>A.</em> cf. <em>antarctica</em> is purple (dorsally) in colour and its lower neurochaetae are similar to upper and middle groups, with distinct serration on the margin and hirsute tips. Greater number of complete, better preserved specimens is necessary to fully diagnose this species and establish its identity, with a revision of this genus needed (see separate entry).</p>

<p><strong><em>Euphionella patagonica </em>Monro, 1936</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>Sea Lion station: 24MFB and station 29MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Voucher specimens complete; large, 20 to 55mm long and up to 16mm wide (including parapodia), with 25 chaetigers (this number is constant), 12 pairs of elytra, fleshy pseudoelytra on cirrigerous segments and branchiae detected from chaetiger 4.</p>
<p>Prostomium bilobed, longer than wide; ceratophore of median antenna in anterior notch, lateral antennae inserted terminally, styles of antennae long, smooth, expanded subdistally then narrowing into slender tip; 2 pairs of very faint eyes situated posteriorly on prostomium. Large, thick palps densely papillated, reddish longitidunal line can be detected on each palp on inner side.</p>
<p>Twelve pairs of large leathery elytra, covering dorsum on segments 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25; lateral margin of elytra dorso- and ventrolaterally with many long, very soft, dense papillae; elytral surface always covered with small flattened, rounded microtubercules, additional with various number (usually around 30) small, distally inflated and papillated macrobtubercules; from around 4<sup>th</sup> elytral pair, very large, distally inflated papillated macrotubercules appear located on raised area around the attachments, varying in number from around 1-2 anteriorly to around 7 posteriorly. Fleshy pseudoelytra present on cirrigerous chaetigers (those not carrying elytra), distally with crenulated edge with large median crenulation and pair of shorter crenulations on each side, surface transparent; with 5 (in smaller voucher) to 10 (in large voucher) transverse lines and small rounded vesicles.</p>
<p>Parapodia biramous. Notopodia extremely reduced; with acicula; from 4<sup>th</sup> notopodium with few, short branchial filaments attached basally (can be easily overlooked); dorsal cirri with long smooth styles. Neuropodia massive, appear inflated; with short acicular lobe; edges sparsely covered by small papillae; ventral cirri very short, smooth.</p>
<p>Notochaetae, numerous but extremely soft and fine, finely serrated. Neurochaetae dark red to brown, very stout, large, unidentate, smooth spines up to 20 per fascicle, with 2-3 lowermost modified into spear-shaped tip. Nephridial papillae distinct from chaetiger 5 (although small can be detected from chaetiger 4). Pygidium simple lobe with a pair of short lateral cirri.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Genus <em>Euphionella</em> is represented by four large bodied species (all with 25 segments), so far found only from deep-waters off South American continent:</p>
<p><em>Euphionella lobulata</em> (Seidler, 1922) from Calbuco, Chile; <em>E. patagonica </em>Monro, 1936 from Patagonia; <em>E.</em> <em>robusta</em> Wesenberg-Lund, 1962 from Chile and <em>E. besnardi</em> Amaral and Nonato, 1985 from Brazil. Of those species Falkland Island specimens agree with <em>Euphionella patagonica </em>Monro, 1936 as it is the only species in which spear-shaped (also referred to as spatulate) chaetae in neuropodial fascicle were reported. It also agrees in having palps densely covered by papillae, long median antenna in relation to lateral antennae, nephridial papilla and ornamentation of elytra (detailed description given by Monro can be accessed here:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/28331"">http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/28331#page/75/mode/1up</a>). It is important to note that degree of ornamentation of elytra varies with the size of specimen and also in different body regions in each specimen. It is generally accepted that the first pair of elytra is not diagnostic in Polynoidae, however in large bodied <em>Euphionella </em>up to<em> </em>first 3-4 elytra can be without very large macrotubercules (possessing microtubercules and variable number of smaller papillataed macrotubercules only), which are mostly developed and present in greatest number in mid to posterior elytra. The transition between small and large papillated macrotubercules is gradual and determining the exact number of each type can be difficult. Monro's specimen is only about 20mm long, similar in size to smaller specimens encountered in Falklands collection, while the largest specimen collected from FI is 55mm long. The size variation was already noted by Wesenberg-Lund (1962) and Hartmann-Schröder (1965) who investigated specimens of 35 and 36mm in length respectively.</p>

Cirrigerous segments (those not carrying elytra) with large, broad, conical dorsal tubercule inserted at the same level as elytrophores of elytra-carrying segments; cirrophores of dorsally cirri very prominent, long cylindrical, inserted medially on notopodia (near fascicle of notochaetae), style of dorsal cirri very long slender, papillated similar to antennae and tentacular cirri. Ventral cirri, from chatiger 3, shortest of all appeandages, but still of considerable length, approaching the acicular tip; slender smooth; inserted medially on neuropodia. On ventrum, small digiform nephridial papilla detected from chaetiger 5.</p>
<p>Notochaetae numerous, of varying lengths, stout with distinct rows of spines and blunt tips, straw-coloured. Upper and middle neurochaetae strait, slender, very long, with rows of spines subdistally, tips of neurochaetae unidentate and hirsute; lower neurochaetae similar to upper and middle neurochaetae, but shorter, distally bent; with distinct rows of spines and also hirsute.</p>
<p>Pygidium with pair of very long, very slender, sparsely papillated lateral cirri.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Genus <em>Austrolaenilla</em> is well represented in Southern Ocean, with <em>A. antarctica</em> being the type species of the genus described by Bergström (1916) from South Georgia. Currently 4 to 5 species are reported from the Southern Ocean (<em>A. fulgens </em>has been considered subspecies of A. <em>antarctica</em>). It is evident from Hartman (1964) that species have been confused in the past as specimens of Monro (1930) and of Fauvel (1936) are different species, which in turn reflects the variation reported by Bergström (1916) who recognised more than one morphotypes in his original description (his description appears to be based on syntypes). Falkland Island specimen agrees well with Bergströms (1916) type 4, which he described as very large (over 50mm long), with faint small eyes and elytral surface covered entirely by microtubercles (as oppose to type 2, which was smaller, less than 20mm long, well developed eyes with anterior pair dorsolaterally, microtubercules limited to small patch on elytra). <em>A. hastulifera</em> (Pruvot in Fauvel, 1936) would appear also to agree with the diagnosis of type 4. Recent molecular work also suggested that <em>A. antarctica</em> may represent species complex (Neal et al., 2014) and taxonomic revision of <em>Austrolaenilla</em> species from the Southern Ocean is needed. Juveniles of this species are commonly encountered in benthopelagic samples and were previously considered to be <em>Herdmanella gracilis</em> (see Neal et al., 2014 for details).</p>

<p><strong><em>Euchone </em>sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher specimens. </strong>INFLEX: station 2MFB.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Small bodied, slender species; voucher specimen with body complete, but branchial crown missing; 6.5 mm long (body)  and 0.5 mm wide, with 8 thoracic and 19 abdominal chaetigers with 7 of these associated with pre-pygidial depression; colour in alcohol pale yellow. </p>
<p>Collar well developed; of similar height all around, only slightly higher ventrally than dorsally; with mid-dorsal margins overlapping; anterior margin entire ventrally with a shallow midventral notch. Glandular ridge present on chaetiger 2, very narrow. </p>
<p>Collar chaetae narrowly limbate arranged in single longitudinal somewhat oblique row; superior and inferior notochaetae of limbate, 3-4 per fascicle. Thoracic neuropodial uncini acicular, about 3 per fascicle.  Companion chaetae absent. Abdominal chaetae on short, slightly elevated neuropodia, with elongate narrowly limbate chaetae. Notopodia of anterior abdominal chaetigers with quadrate avicular uncini with five rows of similar-sized teeth over main fang, covering half its length, well developed breast and very short handle. </p>

<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>A commonly reported species <em>Euchone pallida </em>described by Ehlers (1908) from Kerguelen Island also lacks broad mucronate notochaetae<strong>. </strong>Ehlers (1908) based his description on relatively small holotype,  22mm long for body plus 14mm for branchial crown and 3 mm wide, for 8 thoracic and 32 abdominal segments, with 12 of those forming the pre-pygidial (anal) depression. Licciano et al. (2007) provided re-description of <em>E. pallida </em>and added valuable information on internal structure of the crown and methyl green pattern based on medium-sized specimens. However specimens of different sizes were considered to belong to <em>E. pallida</em> by different authors (i.e. Hartman, 1978) with considerable variation not just in size, but also number of abdominal segments and the number forming the anal depression. It is possible that different species were lumped under this name as number of abdominal segments is considered of taxonomic character in Sabellidae. In Falkland Island material, specimens with differing number of abdominal segments (19 and 27 respectively, also differing in number of both thoracic and abdominal uncini per ramus) and with different methyl green pattern (see comparative image) are here considered to be different species.  Neither of these two species is likely to belong to <em>E. pallida</em> of Ehlers, 1897 as these are much smaller in body size (6.5 and 9.5 mm as oppose to 22 mm) as it is often typical for deep-water fauna (specimens collected from  ~1000m), possess fewer abdominal segments and differ in staining pattern.  Licciano et al. (2009) provided description of methyl green staining pattern as:  a homogeneous dark coloration of thorax and abdomen with distinct intra-segmental furrow, except for presence of thin glandular ridge on chaetiger two, without stain on the collar as apparent from their Figure 1B. <em>Euchone</em> sp. 1 may correspond to what Hartmans (1978) recorded of as juvenile of <em>E. pallida</em> (see comparative table below). These small bodied specimens likely represent a new species (see comparative table for <em>Euchone</em> species recorded so far from Southern Ocean and Magellan region), but complete specimens with branchial crowns will be necessary to fully diagnose these species.</p>

<p>Pygidium as low, wide lobe; no cirri or pygidial eyes observed. Tube not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>The genus <em>Perkinsiana </em>resembles other genera, particularly <em>Potamilla</em> Malmgren, 1866 and <em>Parasabella</em> Bush, 1905; while <em>Potaspina </em>Hartman, 1969<em> </em>can be distinguished with relative ease by replacement of typical thoracic uncini by acicular spines (Giangrande and Gambi, 1997). Knight-Jones (1983) re-define some of these (i.e. <em>Potamilla </em>lacks well developed radiolar appendages supporting the dorsal lips), while establishing genus <em>Perkinsiana</em>. Even though a clear synapomorphy for this genus is still missing (Rouse 1996, Capa 2007), the length of handle of thoracic uncini and development of hood of abdominal neurochaete has been considered of taxonomic importance. Genus <em>Perkinsiana</em> is particularly diverse in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters and has a confused taxonomic past (good regional summary and key provided by Giandgrande and Gambi, 1997 and more recently updated by Tovar-Hernandez et al. (2012)). Of the known species of <em>Perkinsiana</em>, there are currently 5 species recorded from the area with large number of thoracic uncini (40+). Morphospecies <em>Perkinsiana</em> sp. 1 shows differences to those species as well as to <em>Perkinsiana?</em> sp. 2 also found in this study and likely represents a new species (see Table below). The main differences are its relatively small size and neurochaetae with a basal broad knee, distally narrowing abruptly.</p>

<p>V<strong>oucher specimens.</strong> Vinson West: Station 3BMFA; Easting: 562480; Northing: 4534323; 433 m.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Body long, linear; 9 mm long, 0.75 mm wide; segments number 29 (Plate 1a.); body with longitudinal ventral groove; last four chaetigers characteristically short and crowded, pushed towards mid-ventral line. Prostomium conical, longer than wide, terminating in a small palpode (Plate 1a,b.); with pair of nuchal organs appearing as reddish to brown spots. Branchiae cirriform (Plate 1b.), on all chaetigers except first one and last four; small and thin in mid body region. Anal cylinder long, smooth, with the dorsal edge slightly longer than the ventral edge (Plate 1c.), ending in several small indistinct lobes (Plate 1d.).</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> <em>Ophelina breviata</em> has been commonly reported from Antarctic and South American waters (Ehlers 1913; Monro 1930; Monro 1939; Hartman, 1953; Hartman 1966; Hartman 1978; Elias et al. 2003; Maciolek and Blake 2006). In material from Falkland Islands, many specimens with branchiae missing in the middle were also found and although these could have been superficially assigned to <em>O. breviata </em>(given the similarity of anal funnel with extended dorsal lobe) with branchiae assumed missing, these in fact represent a different species assigned here to <em>Ophelina cf. cylindricaudata</em> (see below). Similar observation was made by Maciolek and Blake (2006), who suggested that material examined by Hartman (1978) from the Weddell Sea and Hero Inlet, which lacked branchiae on the majority of middle body chaetigers may represent a species distinct from <em>O. breviata</em>; perhaps <em>O. cylindricaudata </em>(Hansen 1878), as reported by Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt (1989) as a new record for the Antarctic.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Body long, linear, 10.5 -12mm  long (inclusive of 1.3-1.5mm length of anal funnel) and 0.75-0.9mm wide; segments number 28 (irrespective of the size of the specimens); colour in alcohol yellow; body with longitudinal ventral groove; last four chaetigers characteristically short and crowded (Plate 1c). Prostomium conical, longer than wide, sharply pointed, with a small palpode and a pair of large, well-developed, reddish to brown nuchal organs (Plate 1b.). Branchiae cirriform, 8 pairs present on chaetigers 2-9 (well developed in chaetigers 2-7, very small and easily overlooked on chaetigers 8-9) (Plate 1a.), absent from mid-body region, 5 pairs present in the posterior region on chaetigers 19-24 (Plate 1c.), last four crowded chaetigers without branchiae.

<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> Hansen (1878) described <em>Ophelina cylindricaudata </em>(as A<em>mmotrypane cylindricaudatus</em>) from two specimens collected in 763m and 911 m off the coast of Norway. Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt (1989, 1991) recorded the species from the Antarctic accepting the description and illustration provided by Stop-Bowitz (1945). However, it is possible that the Antarctic species is not the same as <em>O. cylindricaudata</em> (Hansen), which has been recorded primarily from Arctic waters and further analysis, including molecular techniques encompassing additional material from both Arctic and Antarctic waters is necessary before a conclusion can be reached.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution. </strong> <em>O. cylindricaudata </em> is known from Arctic and Antarctic Seas, 7-4663 m; Southern Ocean material of <em>O. cylindricaudata</em> sensu Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt (1989) was recorded from ca. 65-600 m, Falkland Islands.</p>

<p><strong><em>Ophelina farallonensis</em>  Blake, 2000</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher specimens.</strong> Sea Lion: Station 53MFC</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Body small, cylindrical, rigid, glossy, sleek in appearance (almost nematode-like) (Plate 1a.), with mid ventral groove throughout; annulations poorly developed; with 18 segments; 4mm long for body and 0.6mm for length of caudal funnel, body 0.3mm wide; colour in alcohol pale yellow to white. Branchiae entirely absent. Prostomium (Plate 1b.) conical tapering into pointed tip bearing a small terminal palpode; pair of very small red eyes appear to be present (Plate 1b.); lateral nuchal organs not conspicuous. Parapodia bi-ramous, very reduced, the last 4 not shortened and crowded. Chaetae all slender capillaries, notochaetae longer than neurochaetae; the chaetae of the last segment longer than in preceding segments. Anal funnel long (approximately 1/5 of total worm length), thin, cylindrical, bearing a slender cirrus positioned ventrally from near posterior end (Plate 1c.); in majority of specimens the anal funnel has been lost.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> The specimen collected from Falkland Islands agree well with the description of <em>O. farallonensis</em> a deep species from Northern California (Blake, Hilbig & Scott 2000). The future studies, including molecular techniques may confirm if the Falkland Island specimens belong to this species. To complicate matters further, the abranchiate species from northern European <em>Ophelina abranchiata</em> Støp-Bowitz, 1948 was described from the specimen missing the anal funnel and later authors described funnel in <em>O. abranchiata </em>consistent with the one in <em>O. farallonensis</em> (Blake, 2000). In recent work on North Sea Opheliidae, Kongsgrud et al. (2011) reported that the only morphological difference between two species is the size, with adult specimens of <em>O. abranchiata</em> (10 mm long and 0.8 wide) being considerably larger than <em>O. farallonensis</em> (4.5 mm long and 0.35 mm wide). Additionally records of abranchiate opheliid with 30 segments - <em>Ophelina nematoides</em> - from Antarctic waters can be found (Harman 1966). This species (if valid and not described from a damaged specimen) is clearly different from FI material in having a much greater number of segments.</p>

Prostomium conical (Plate 1b.), terminating in large palpode; with a pair of large reddish to brown nuchal organs. Branchiae present from chaetiger 2 (Plate 1b.), absent from last six chaetigers, all cirriform, large, only slightly reduced in size in the most posterior segments. The last 4 chaetigers not particularly short and crowded.

<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> In Falkland Islands material only two specimens were found showing all characters above, while several more damaged specimens were also observed. Damage was to the posterior region with branchiae generally missing after segment 20 (but a few could still be observed) as well as all cirri associated with anal funnel missing. The distinctive anal funnel on this species is very similar to that found on the widespread species <em>Ophelina acuminata</em>. Nevertheless, Ehlers (1900) erected <em>A. scaphigera</em> for the Antarctic species. While some authors (Elias et al., 2003) report <em>O</em>. cf. <em>acuminata</em> from 33-71 m off SE Brazil, most authors consider <em>A.scaphigera </em>to be a valid species at present.

<p><strong><em>Eclysippe</em></strong><strong> sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>Sea Lion: station 90MFB</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Voucher is a complete specimen, 14mm long and 0.6mm wide. Thorax consists of paleae bearing segment and 15 chaetigers, 12 of these uncinigers; abdomen with 12 uncinigers.  Thorax divided into two regions: (1) anterior thoracic chaetigers (chaetigers 1-9) short (first two particularly crowded) with well developed ventral glandular pads, using Shirla-stain, bands on ventrum of these chaetigers particularly strong in uncinigers 1 and 2; chaetiger 10 transitory between two regions; (2) posterior thoracic chaetigers (=last 5) very long, glandular pads not developed.  First and second notopodia smaller than on subsequent segments, close together, first pair in particular obscured by segment with paleae and branchial ridge. Abdominal segments without rudimental notopodia or neuropodial cirri. Pygidium formed of two small lobes.</p>
<p>Prostomium  <em>Ampharete-</em>type, trilobed (appear as a single triangular lobe), without glandular ridges. Lower lip crenulated.  Paleae present, arising from large cylindrical lobes, about 10 per fascicle, pale yellow in colour, very slender,  long (reaching the anterior end of prostomium), tapering into thin tips. Three pairs of branchiae arranged in one row, two groups separated by a narrow median gap; styles of branchiae mostly missing, only two still attached in voucher, these are smooth, long, slender and cylindrical; all branchiophores of equal size, connected laterally giving impression of raised ridge, long - obscuring prostomium dorsally.</p>
<p>Notochaetae few, long, smooth, narrowly limbate. Thoracic uncini with 6 small teeth above rostral tooth arranged in two alternating vertical rows; first two abdominal neuropodia of thoracic type; following abdominal neuropodia with different uncini, each with 5 teeth in lateral view, forming paw pattern in frontal view.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Falkland Island specimens are most similar to Northern European species <em>Eclysippe vanelli</em> (Fauvel, 1936), which has been widely reported, but it appears there are some inconsistencies particularly in the form of abdominal uncini. Jirkov (2011) commented that <em>Eclysippe</em> belongs to a group of ampharetid genera where the first two abdominal uncinigers are of thoracic type. Holthe (1986) and Jirkov (2001) used drawings taken from Eliason (1955) to show abdominal uncini of different type to thoracic ones, however Aguirrezabalaga and Parapar (2014) reported abdominal uncini (posterior to abdominal uncinigers 1 and 2) similar to thoracic ones. The shape of posterior abdominal uncini is markedly different from those in thorax in Falkland Island specimens and different from those figured by Eliason (1955). Paleae also appear to be much longer in FI specimens than those in <em>E. vanelli</em>. We suggest that FI specimens probably represent a new species, however further work would be necessary to examine specimens of <em>Eclysippe vanelli</em> from other geographical location and most importantly, the type specimen of Fauvel (1936). The other two currently recognised species of <em>Eclysippe</em> are different from FI specimens.  <em>Eclysippe eliasoni</em> (Day, 1973) has 13-14 abdominal segments,  notopodia 1 and 2 well spaced  and not protruding from large cylindrical lobes (based on drawing provided by Day, 1973), type locality Beaufort, North Carolina in 200 m (see notes about the status of this species in WoRMS database). Pacific species <em>Eclysippe trilobata</em> (Hartman, 1969) differs in body shape without extreme lengthening of the thorax  (ch. 1-6 shorter, separated ventrally by a deep furrow, rest of the thorax with slightly longer chaetigers, based on re-description by Hilbig, 2000), paleae are stouter and abdominal uncini described as similar to thoracic ones.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks</strong>. The specimens collected from Falkland Islands agree well with the description of <em>A. foodbancsia</em>, which has been described from the shelf of Bellingshausen Sea (Mincks et al., 2009). Due to lack of complete specimens in Falkland Island material, it is impossible to compare the occurrence and form of notopodial hooded hooks and form of pygidium with <em>A. foodbancsia</em>.</p>

Neuropodial hooded hooks appear from chaetiger 15. The rest of the body unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Although only incomplete diagnosis could be given based on 3 (one of them rather damaged) specimens, the characters observed are enough to conclude that FI specimen constitutes a different species form <em>Scolelepis</em> currently known from the region (see Table 1. for summary). The species most similar to FI specimens is <em>Scolelepis eltaninae </em>Blake, 1983  in abruptly narrowing extension of anterior prostomial margin, possessing the occipital antenna and notochaetae in first chaetiger. The two species clearly differ in distribution and form on neuropodial hooded hooks (see Table 1 for details). The FI specimen very likely represent a new species and will be formally described.</p>

<p><strong><em>Eusamythella sexdentata</em></strong> <strong>(Hartman, 1967)  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>TOROA: station T10FB</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Voucher is the only example found in this study; complete specimen; medium sized, slender species, 10mm long and 0.4mm wide. Thorax consists of paleae bearing segment and 14 thoracic chaetigers, of which 12 uncinigers; abdomen with 15 uncinigers. Paleae present, stout, tapering abruptly into asymmetrical tip. Three pairs of branchiae, on a raised ridge (grouped with 1 branchia inserted anteriorly to the other two), two groups of branchiae separated by a small gap; branchial styles smooth, long (with the anteriormost shortest), cylindrical. Raised ridge across dorsum of thoracic chaetiger 2. Notochaetae limbate caplillaries. Abdominal uncinigers without rudimentary notopodia. Pygidium without cirri.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.  </strong>Falkland Island specimens agree well with <em>Eusamythella sexdentata</em> (Hartman, 1967) described from Bransfield Straits, 2119-2562m and also reported from Weddell Sea, 400-659m (Hartman, 1978). </p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Voucher specimens.</strong> Sea Lion: Station 44MFC (1 adult with antenna missing, 1 juvenile with long antenna present), Station 12MFA (specimen with regenerating antenna).</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Voucher 44MFC adult specimen, incomplete 53 segments long fragment, 8mm long and 0.9mm wide, colour in alcohol pale to dark yellow, often with a sort of rusty pigment in the anterior part of the body (both dorsally and ventrally). Prostomium is distinctly pear-shaped, with prominent oblique nuchal organs on posterior part of prostomium; eyes absent.  Unpaired prostomial antenna very long (voucher 44MFC, juvenile, incomplete 2mm long and 0.1mm wide), extending to chaetiger 6 (at its longest), antenna easily lost, in many specimens antenna missing completely or regenerating and of variable length can be extremely short knob-like or extending past segment 1 somewhat arched (voucher 12MFA) .<br />
	Branchiae present from chaetiger 4, easily broken off, can be missing entirely, around ~20 pairs in adults (~14 pairs in juveniles), foliaceous extending into tips, anterior pairs just about meeting in the middle, branchiae becoming longer with 3 (of the last 5) pairs extremely long with bulbous base and very long thin tips, the very last one or two pairs extremely short.<br />
	Notopodial postchaetal lobes very small in prebranchial segments, large angular (elbow-shaped) in branchial region, becoming very thin and long (thread-like) in postbranchial region. Neuropodial lobes inconspicuous.<br />
	Notochaetae always long, dense capillaries. Neurochaetae, in addition to capillaries, distinct spines present from segment 23 in small (juvenile) specimen and 25 in adult, up to 7 per fascicle, appearing somewhat distally bidentate, occasionally with indistinct pubescence, often with short, thin arista arising from the convex side . Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> Important characters, such as antenna and branchiae easily lost in this species, several vouchers were used to show full set of characters of this species. Of the currently known species of <em>Aricidea (Acmira)</em> subgenus the FI specimens is most similar to <em>Aricidea (Acmira) assimilis</em>  Tebble, 1959 in shape of prostomium and length of antenna. Tebbles description is severely lacking in detail. Branchiae are inadequately described to compare these structures and types and paratypes re-examined at NHM London were found to be in poor condition, with most branchiae missing. Importantly the type locality of <em>A. (A.) assimillis</em> is Mediterranean Sea (Israel). During his work on monograph of Paraonidae, Strelzov (1973) re-examined some of Tebbles specimens and additionally described material from the Pacific and South Georgia (SG), which he assigned to <em>A. (A.) assimillis</em>. The FI specimen agree well with the description given by Strelzov (1973) in shape of prostomium, length of antenna, however the shape and length of branchiae  is not well described or pictured by Strelzov (1973). The SG specimens also agree with FI specimens in the form of their modified neurochaetae, although the heavy pubescence found in Strelzovs specimens has not been confirmed in FI specimens. We suggest that FI material (and likely Strelzovs SG material) represent a different species from <em>A. (Acmira) assimilis</em> found in Mediterranean. Additionally, great care should be taken when identifying these specimens, because branchiae and antennae can be easily lost, the specimen in various stages of damage can be found and could be misidentified (i. e. the length of antenna is considered an important taxonomic character in Aricidea, but in this material represent various re-generation stages. </p>

<p><strong>Voucher specimens. </strong>Sea Lion: Stations 28 MFC and 32MFC large, adult specimen; Station 20MFB example of juvenile</p>
<p><strong>D</strong><strong>iagnosis</strong><strong>.</strong> Vouchers incomplete specimens with 23-24 chaetigers, 0.8 mm wide and 4.3-6 mm long (adults). Prostomium bell-shaped, with short anterolateral horns in adult; in juveniles prostomial shape more variable anteriorly rounded to triangular with anterolateral horns less to well developed. Occipital antenna present, large, ciriform. Eyes absent. Dorsal ciliated organs present as two mediolateral lines extending to about chaetigers 14-15 (often indistinct). Peristomium poorly to moderately developed.</p>
<p>Chaetigers 14 with long cirriform to triangular notopodial postchaetal lamellae. Chaetal spreader 0+1 type (see Meißner (2005) for definition) with semicircular glandular opening well developed in chaetigers 57. Ventrolateral intersegmental pouches present from between chaetigers 15-16 (in some juveniles the pouches can appear slightly later in between chaetigers 17-18). Dorsal ciliated crests distinct from about chaetigers 17-18, well developed from about chaetiger 20.</p>
<p>Chaetae of 4 types: capillaries (simple and narrowly limbate); single stout, crook-like chaeta in the neuropodium of chaetiger 1; ventral, granulated at tip sabre chaetae from chaetiger 4; 5-6 neuropodial hooks without hoods from chaetiger 15. Pygidium unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> The specimens collected from Falkland Islands agree well with the description of <em>S. algidus</em>, which also has sub-Antarctic distribution (known from near Crozet Island) in possessing bell-shaped prostomia with an occipital antenna, long dorsal ciliated organs and intersegmental ventrolateral pouches from segment 15 to 16. The Falkland Island specimens differ in the lack of observable pigmentation noted in <em>S. algidus</em> by Meißner (2005).  A large number of small specimens has been collected during the 2012 survey. Given the size of these specimens and the fact that these agree well with the description above (see note on the start of pouches above), the conclusion was made that these represent a juvenile stage of <em>S. algidus</em>. Meißner (2005) remarked that <em>S. algidus</em> is most similar to <em>S. kroyeri</em><em>,</em> whose distribution has been restricted to Northern Europe. Previous faunistic studies recorded <em>S. kroyeri</em> from Falkland Islands (e.g. Blake 1983), but it is likely that these records belong in fact to <em>S. algidus</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Glyphanostomum</em></strong><strong> Levinsen, 1884 </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Glyphanostomum</em></strong><strong> sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>Endeavour: station E6FA</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.  </strong>Voucher is a complete specimen, body long, slender, fragment 15mm long and 0.6mm wide. Tube strongly annulated as typical for the genus, muddy, soft. Thorax composed of 14 chaetigers, of which 11 uncinigers; abdomen posteriorly incomplete; abdomen with 24 uncinigers. First 5 thoracic chaetigers short, subsequent chaetiger progressively longer. Prostomium simple, spade-shaped lobe at anterior end, with a pair of large, but faint red eye-spots. Buccal tentacles not extended, tips smooth. Three pairs of branchiae, arranged in two groups on chaetiger 1, each group with median branchia anteriorly displaced (its branchiphore not visible in dorsal view) to 2 posteriorly laced lateral branchiae with branchiophores exposed and basally fused; two branchial groups separated by a wide gap; styles of branchiae smooth, thin, cylindrical with median pair longest, the lateral pair shorter, of similar length. Notopodia of first and second chaetiger reduced, with second one dorsally displaced; notopodia without cirri. Notochaetae of 2 groups longer, appearing narrowly bilimbate and shorter, simple capillaries. Thoracic uncini with one vertical row of 7 teeth with the second most basal tooth doubled (formula: 1-2-1-1-1-1-1) in frontal view, appearing as 7 teeth above prow. Abdominal uncini with mana small teeth above the main fang, irregularly arranged in multiple rows. Neuropodia free from body wall ventrally. Pygidium with two fleshy, triangular lobes dorsally and ventrally, with smaller lobes laterally; with 2 lateral, medium length cirri.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Currently they are 6 valid species in genus <em>Glyphanostomum</em>, with <em>G. pallescens</em> (Théel, 1879) (type species of this genus) originally described from Arctic (Kara Sea) now considered a cosmopolitan species with wide geographic and bathymetric range.  According to Holthe (1986) type specimen of <em>G. pallescens </em> has been lost, which probably fuelled its cosmopolitan status and variable description of specimens identified as <em>G. pallescens</em> by different authors from around the world (see for example Holthe, 1986; Hilbig in Blake et al., 2000; Jirkov, 2001; Reusher et al., 2015). Falkland Island specimens are very similar to <em>G. pallescens</em> in number of abdominal chaetigers, with 24-25 reported by Théel (1879) (but see discussion in Reuscher et al., 2015). The main taxonomic characters (see comparative Table used for <em>Glyphanostomum</em> species) are arrangement of branchiae (Reuscher et. al, 2009), form of thoracic uncini and number of abdominal uncinigers. Combination of these characters in Falkland specimens suggests that these may represent a new species. The branchial arrangement which is grouped in 1+2 fashion (the middle branchia is positioned anteriorly to two other pairs and not visible basally as it should be in oblique or transverse row arrangement) is unique among the known <em>Glyphanostomum</em> species so far. Further thoracic uncini are arranged in a single row, but the second basalmost tooth is doubled (Hilbig in Blake, 2000 imaged a similar arraignment in Pacific specimens of <em>G. pallescens</em>). <em>G. scotiarum </em>described from deep waters of Drake Passage, Weddell Sea and South Orkneys possess 33 abdominal uncinigers. In her description of <em>G. scotiarum</em>  Hartman  (1978) did not comment on the form of thoracic uncini in frontal view or detailed the branchial arrangement, which is considered to be in an oblique row (based on her drawing, branchiae appear basally visible and not grouped as in Falkland specimens). </p>

"<a href=""/node/79"">Sternaspidae Carus, 1863</a>"," <p><strong> Sternaspidae Carus, 1863</strong></p>
<p><strong>Genus<em> Sternaspis</em></strong><strong> Otto, 1821</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Sternaspis</em></strong><strong> sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher specimens</strong>. Sea Lion: Stations 90MFB (2 adults) and 22 MFC (adults and subadults).</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>.  Small species (relative to other species of Sternaspidae); voucher complete specimens (adults), 9 mm long,  3 mm wide (at widest part of abdomen), 31  segments introvert exposed . Body colour in alcohol light brown to greyish. The body has narrow introvert, with bulbous head of 2:3 width ratio to widest part of abdomen and very narrow waist segments (the narrowest part of the body) at 1:3 width ratio to the widest part of the abdomen. Cuticular papillae evenly distributed over most of the body (can be eroded in larger specimens) especially obvious at narrowest part of the introvert.</p>
<p>Prostomium hemispherical, opalescent, without eyespots. Peristomium rounded, without papillae. Mouth slightly oval, completely covered by papillae. First three chaetigers with 8-13 bronze, widely separated, slightly falcate hooks per ramus, with subdistal dark areas, transparent in juveniles, opaque in larger specimens, with thin arista-like spine distally (often broken off). Genital papillae protrude ventrally from intersegmental groove between segments 7 and 8.</p>
<p>Ventro-caudal shield  orange in juveniles, darker orange to light brown in adults; ribbed, often covered by sediment; concentric bands not obvious; anterior margins rounded; deep suture running through the shield; lateral margins straight in smaller specimens, curved in larger specimens, expanding posteriorly. Fan projecting beyond posterior corners, smooth, with a well-developed median notch .</p>
<p>Marginal chaetae fascicles include 10 lateral ones in an oval arrangement, and 67 posterior fascicles arranged in an approximately ventro-dorsal line. Lateral chaetae are longest in their most posterior position; light bronze proximally along the shafts, grading to almost clear at the distal ends; the posteriomost lateral 3-4 fascicles overlap with the short posterior chaetae, but clearly set behind these, the last lateral fascicle often present as only one or few chaetae and can be easily overlooked. Posterior chaeatal fascicle short, getting progressively longer toward the outer margin of the shield.</p>
<p>Branchiae stout, coiled, protruding from two oval, obliquely set plates, one on either side of anus. Many long filamentous interbranchial papillae with sediment particles attached.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> FI specimens superficially agree well with <em>S. fossor </em>(considered to have a distribution limited to North American Atlantic coast) in body colour, shape of caudal shield (including sediment encrustation), papillation, possession of 10 lateral shield chaetae and 6-7 posterior chaetae (this number is fixed in other species, not variable). FI specimens differ in not having obvious concentric lines in their shield unlike the <em>S. fossor</em>. Additionally, the two species possess different body shapes with <em>S. fossor </em>generally having a very thick introvert, while it is thin in FI specimens. The body shape has not been really assessed as taxonomic character so far, but given examination of several other species (see below), we suggest that there is consistency to the body shape, which varies among the species.</p>
<p><em>Sternaspis</em> had been recorded from Southern Ocean and South America by previous authors (see reference in Sendall and Salazar-Vallejo 2013) and commonly assigned to species <em>S. scutata</em> (possessing 6 posterior shield chaetae). None of these authors gave a detailed description of their specimens, as given the distinctive shape of Sternaspidae, they have assumed that their material belongs to a few or even one species most notably <em>S. scutata</em>. Recent revision work by Sendall and Salazar-Vallejo (2013) showed this assumption to be incorrect and restricted the distribution of <em>S. scutata </em>to Mediterranean and Northeastern Atlantic, eventually leading to a description of two new species from the Southern Ocean <em>S. monroi</em> and <em>S. sendalli </em>(Salazar-Vallejo, 2014). Type specimens of <em>S. monroi</em> and <em>S. sendalli </em> were elected from the historical collection held at NHM London and were re-examined in here. The differences between two known species from the Southern Ocean and new FI species are summarized in table below.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lysippe</em></strong><strong> cf. <em>fragilis</em> (Wollebaeck, 1912)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>LOLIGO: station L3FA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Voucher is a complete specimen (branchial styles missing), body slender 10mm long and 0.6mm wide. Thorax consists of paleae bearing segment and 17 chaetigers, 14 of these uncinigers; abdomen with 8 uncinigers.  First three notopodia smaller than on subsequent segments, close together, second and third pair displaced dorsally.  Abdominal segments without rudimental notopodia or neuropodial cirri. Pygidium formed of several small lobes.</p>
<p>Prostomium  <em>Ampharete-</em>type, trilobed  - the middle lobe large square-shaped only slightly wider than lateral lobes, with large blotches composed of small pigmented dots. Lower lip well developed, forming high membrane, only very weakly crenulated on anterior margin, with approximately 5 large folds.  Paleae present, arising from cylindrical lobes, pale yellow in colour, very fine, small  (can be overlooked), slightly shorter than notochaetae, tapering into thin tip.</p>
<p>Four pairs of branchiae in 3 + 1 arrangement, two groups of branchiae separated by a small median gap; styles of branchiae missing; branchiophores connected laterally giving impression of raised ridge.</p>
<p>Notochaetae few, long, smooth, limbate. Thoracic and abdominal uncini similar, with many small teeth above rostral tooth forming paw pattern in frontal view.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Several ampharetid genera with 14 thoracic uncinigers were synonymised with genus <em>Lysipp</em>e Malmgren, 1866 by Jirkov (2011). This synonymy included genus <em>Lysippides</em> Hessle, 1917  in which  Wollebaeck (1912) placed species <em>Lyssipides fragilis, </em>which he described form Northern Europe. Falkland Island specimens agree well with this Northern European species in many characters - shape of prostomium, presence of pigmentation on prostomium, branchial arrangement, form of paleae and uncini, number of thoracic chaetigers and uncinigers, as well as possessing 8 abdominal uncinigers. The only difference is in the form of pygidium, which has two lateral cirri in <em>L. fragilis</em>, but it is only composed of several short lobes in FI specimen. However only one example of this species was collected from Falkland Islands and it is possible that pygidial cirri are missing. Until further evidence becomes available, we suggest the use of cf. when identifying this species.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher</strong>. INFLEXIBLE: Station 1MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong> Medium sized, robust species. Voucher specimen incomplete with 35 segments, 2.5mm long and 0.75mm wide. Body robust, dorsoventrally flattened with crowded segments in anterior part of the body, widest between chaetigers 4-9; colour in alcohol dark yellow.<br />
	Prostomium much wider than long, often arched dorsally with hunchback look, large middle lobe anteriorly flattened and separated from the side lobes by notches; nuchal slits prominent on two prostomial lateral lobes. Long thin antenna extends to chaetiger 5 in voucher specimen. <br />
	Branchiae from chaetiger 4, 8 pairs, not meeting at midline where the body is widest (chaetigers 4-9), reducing in size posteriorly (reaching midline as the body becomes more narrow), all very broad, oval, distally narrowing into short but acute tips.<br />
	Notopodial postchaetal lobes developed, smaller on segments 1-3 then getting longer in branchial region, branched (bi-lobed) lobes occur on segments 3- 8 (the second branch is extremely small in chaetiger 3, but clearly observed in shirla-stained specimens).  Neuropodial lobes prominent, oval flaps, largest in branchial region.<br />
	Notochaetae always capillaries, long and dense in anterior part of the body;  modified neurochaetae begin to transition from chaetiger 21 in voucher specimen, increasing in number and in thickness (up to 7 per fascicle on the last segment), only thickened gently curved chaetae with long thin arista observed in 35 chaetigers long fragment, accompanied by several long capillaries.<br />
	Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> <em>Aricidea antennata</em> and <em>A. quadrilobata </em>Webster and Benedict, 1887 were synonimized by Strelzov (1973), but represent distinct species according to Blake (1996) who based this conclusion on an examination of numerous specimens from both the Atlantic and Pacific sides of North America. According to Blake (1996) the Atlantic species should be called <em>A. quadrilobata</em> and has the broad prostomium and single notopodial postsetal lobes, while the Pacific form has the truncated prostomium and double notopodial lobes. Our specimens agree well with <em>A. antennata</em> in possessing double notopodial lobes in anterior segments 3-8, although Blake's specimens had these in segments 5 -14. Further, there appear to be some differences in branchial structure as Blake's Pacific specimens have posterior branchiae with long, filamentous tips, but tips in FI specimens are all short. Heavy spines reported by Blake were not observed, but it is possible that FI specimens are too shorter fragments in order to observe full variety of modified notochaetae. Until more material is available, we assign the FI specimens to <em>Aricidea (Allia) </em>cf.<em> antennata </em>Annenkova, 1934.</p>

The presence of small branchial stumps (initially observed at least on chaetigers 2 and 3, but now lost due to damage during the examination), the shape of prostomium and the form and distribution of neuropodial hooded hooks make this specimen consistent with genus <em>Prionospio</em> Malmgren, 1867. The distribution and form of branchiae is an important diagnostic character in this genus therefore a better specimen, with full branchial set is needed to fully diagnose this species. The particularly prominent dorsal crests on chaetigers 5-7 make this species easily recognisable from other spionid species collected from Falkland Islands.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lysippe</em></strong><strong> sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>Sea Lion: station 45MFB</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Voucher is a complete specimen (branchiae missing), body relatively slender 14mm long and 1.2mm wide. Thorax consists of paleae bearing segment and 16 chaetigers, 13 of these uncinigers; abdomen with 12 uncinigers.  First three notopodia smaller than on subsequent segments, close together, second and third pair displaced dorsally. Abdominal segments without rudimental notopodia or neuropodial cirri, torus of first abdominal unciniger reduced. Pygidium formed of several small lobes.</p>
<p>Prostomium  <em>Ampharete-</em>type, trilobed  - the middle lobe almost square-shaped only slightly wider than lateral lobes, without glandular ridges. Lower lip crenulated with approximately 15 folds.  Paleae present, arising from cylindrical lobes, about 10 per fascicle, pale yellow in colour, very fine, small  (can be overlooked), slightly shorter than notochaetae, tapering into thin tip; under high magnification two types can be discerned, slightly thicker, narrowly limbate capillaries and simple threadlike capillaries.  </p>
<p>Four pairs of branchiae 2 + 2 arrangement, two groups separated by a distinct median gap; styles of branchiae missing,  branchiophores of equal size, connected laterally giving impression of raised ridge and obscuring prostomium dorsally.</p>
<p>Notochaetae few, long, smooth, limbate. Thoracic uncini with 4-5 small teeth above rostral tooth arranged in two alternating vertical rows; first two abdominal neuropodia of thoracic type; following abdominal neuropodia with different uncini, each with 5 teeth in lateral view, forming paw pattern in frontal view.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Only two species in the genus <em>Lysippe </em>have been described with 17 thoracic chaetigers (including paleae), 13 thoracic uncinigers and cirriform branchiae (character which cannot be confirmed in FI specimen) - the type species <em>L. labiata </em>from Northern Europe (Spitzbergen) and <em>L. nipponica</em> from Nagasaki Bay, Japan in 50m. Both of these appear to differ from FI specimen in form of thoracic and/or abdominal uncini and it is likely that these represent a new species. However careful examination of type specimens will be necessary to confirm this. </p>

<p><strong>Voucher.</strong> Hero: Station 1MFA</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Voucher is the only specimen collected in this study. Incomplete, small and slender specimen 4mm long and 0.2mm wide for 23 chaetigers (of these last 6 are enlarged, swollen, without obvious segmentation, likely regenerating).</p>
<p>Prostomium anteriorly rounded, posteriorly extending to the end of chaetiger 1 as an elongated, slender caruncle; eyes absent. Peristomium partially fused to chaetiger 1, not pronounced into lateral wings. Branchiae missing in all chaetigers, but at chaetiger 2 a small, digitiform branchia was observed (on one side only). Notopodial and neuropodial lamellae are prominent, both narrow, elongated, protruding away from the body (rather than lying flat on the body), similar size in chaetigers 2-16, smaller in chaetiger 1, absent from chaetiger 17 until end of fragment (the swollen, regenerating region). All chaetae capillaries; sabre chaetae and hooded hooks absent in 23 chaetigers long fragment. Dorsal crests absent. Pygidium unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong>. The presence of small branchial stumps (initially observed at least on chaetigers 2 and 3, but now lost due to damage during the examination), the shape of prostomium suggest this species may belong to genus <em>Prionospio</em> Malmgren, 1867. However absence of neuropodial hooks in 23 chaetigers is unusual in this genus (hooded hook normally start in chaetigers 10-20, see Paterson et al., 2015). The distribution and form of branchiae, an important diagnostic feature is also unknown in this specimen. While this species can be distinguished from the other spionid material from Falkland Islands by combination of shape of prostomium, podial lamellae and absence of any modified chaetae, its identity cannot be established based on currently available material.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong>  Small sized, slender species; voucher specimens incomplete, 2-2.5mm long, 0.2mm wide, incomplete with around 29-40 chaetigers (body is posteriorly strongly coiled, difficult to determine the number of segments); colour in alcohol white.<br />
	Prostomium weakly pear-shaped, with prominent oblique nuchal organs on posterior part of prostomium; eyes absent. Prostomial antenna very short (reaching to segment 1), appears bi-articulate with inflated base and distally extending into slender tip.<br />
	Branchiae present from chaetiger 4, 7 pairs; broadly oval, distally extending into short acute tip, all pairs similar in length, just about meeting in the middle .<br />
	Notopodial postchaetal lobes very small, oval in segment 1 and 2, becoming longer with wider base (flask-shaped) on segment 3, retaining this shape in branchial segments but becoming angular (elbow-shaped), becoming very thin and long (thread-like) in postbranchial region.<br />
	Notochaetae always simple capillaries, most dense in anterior part of the body. Modified chaetae of similar thickness to capillary neurochaetae but shorter, some gently, some strongly bent, and tapering to very fine, hair-like tip, beginning past chaetiger 20 (difficult to confirm due to coiling of the specimens), 3 per fascicle appear to be present, accompanied by think capillaries.

<p><strong>Voucher specimens.</strong> Sea Lion: Station 65MFC (adult), Station 51MFA (adult), Station 29MFA (juvenile), Station 37MFC (juvenile).</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis </strong>(Adult). A large, robust species; vouchers incomplete 29 - 45mm long and 2.7 - 3mm wide for 50 and 58 segments; thorax anteriorly wide, dorsoventrally flattened, narrowing posteriorly; abdomen cylindrical. Colour in alcohol dark yellow. Prostomium short, conical, sharp. Branchiae from chaetiger 5, continuing to the end of the fragments, strap-like, triangular, progressively increasing in size. Thorax divided into anterior (chaetigers 1-10) and posterior (chaetigers 11-18(19)) areas, with spear-shaped spines in neuropodia, with ventral papillae regions. Notopodia of anterior thoracic region with large bulbous (very wide and round basally extending into slender tip) postchaetal lobes and dense crenulated capillaries (long and sort). Neuropodia of anterior thoracic region low lobes with a single row of large (up to 15), triangular podial papillae, with single row of crenulated capillaries and  3 rows of modified spines; spines thick, short, distally bent, with transverse ridges, yellow to brown in colour. Notopodia of posterior thoracic region similar to preceding chaetigers. Neuropodia of posterior thoracic region with 5-7 large, brown, protruding, spear-shaped spines (often broken off but dark broken stems can be observed). In addition to modified spines and crenulated capillaries; posterior thoracic region with ventral papillae (in addition to similar podial papillae in neuropodia), up to around 20, greatly reduced in number (around 5) in the last chaetiger of this region.</p>
<p>Abdomen from chaetiger 18-19; with bulbous notopodial lobe (similar to those in thorax); long, slender, lanceolate (slightly bulging in the middle) inter-ramal cirrus present; neuropodia with barrel-shaped distally notched lobes; with small triangular ventral cirrus. Notochaetae long, thin, serrated capillaries and furcate chaetae; neurochaetae very few long capillaries (often broken off). Ventral papillae absent. Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis </strong>(Juvenile). Smaller than adults; vouchers incomplete 3 - 5.5mm long and 0.7 - 0.8mm wide for 25 and 30  segments; body shape as in adults; branchiae start from chaetiger 5 as in adults. Thorax (overall) shorter than in adults; anterior region with 1-10 chaetigers (as in adults), posterior region much shorter than in adults with 2-4 chaetigers, bearing protruding spear-shaped spines (often broken off); spear-shaped spines less robust than in adults, often colourless or with yellow to light brown hues, 2-3 per ramus, Ventral papillae present in posterior thoracic region (but in the smallest specimens these are not developed). Abdomen as in adults. All other chaetae as in adults.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> The juvenile specimens can be easily misidentified as <em>Orbinia</em> (if the ventral papillae are clearly present) or as <em>Scoloplos</em> (if the ventral papillae are very few or overlooked), because the spear-shaped spines (hallmark of genus <em>Phylo)</em> are so often broken off. While in adults the spear-shaped spines are also often broken off, their dark, robust stems can be clearly visible. This is often not the case for juveniles (although this is somewhat dependent on the size of the juveniles) and careful examination under compound microscope may be necessary.<br />
	There appears to be some variation in specimens identified as <em>Phylo felix</em> by previous authors subsequent to species original description by Kinberg (1866) (see Ehlers 1900, 1901, Monro 1930, Hartman 1966). <em>Phylo felix heterosetosa</em> has been described by Hartmann-Schröder (1965) from Chile as a result of this variation (e.g. spines not protruding from body wall), but it is possible that other as yet unrecognised species may be present. For example, Hartman (1966) reported spear-shaped spines protruding in chaetigers 11-19 (consistent with FI specimens) in <em>Phylo felix</em>, but ventral papillae were present in chaetigers 11(12) 20 (21), while in FI specimens (adults) the ventral papillae are found in chaetigers 14-18 (19). However it is not possible to establish this without re-examination of specimens from different locations and revision should be carried out.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong>  Voucher is the only specimen collected in this study; a complete specimen, slender, body tapering posteriorly;  pale yellow in alcohol; length 9.5mm, width 1mm (at widest point of the thorax). Thorax composed of 15 chaetigers, of these 12 uncinigers, between chaetiger 3 and 4 with indistinct dorsal crest; abdomen with 27 uncinigers. Prostomium almost pentagonal shaped; without glandular ridges or eyespots.  Buccal tentacles smooth. Paleae absent. Three pairs of branchiae, inserted in a transverse row on a ridge; two groups separated by a median gap; branchial styles long, cylindrical, smooth but with ventral surface of the innermost branchiae ridged (visible only after staining). Anterior notopodia well developed, without cirri. Notochaetae few, smooth, narrowly limbate. Thoracic uncini with 5 teeth above rostral tooth and basal prow arranged in a single vertical row; tori without cirri. Abdominal uncinigers very long with rudimentary notopodia.  Abdominal uncini with many small teeth, arranged in 4 regular horizontal rows. Pygidium with 5 short, fleshy, rounded lobes of similar size; arranged in 1 (median) + 2 lateral pairs with median lobe slightly shorter than others.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Characters of taxonomic importance in genus <em>Samythella </em>are number of abdominal segments and number and form of anal cirri (Fauchald, 1972). There are currently 6 recognised species in this genus and the combination of the characters mentioned above suggest that FI specimen represents a new species (see comparative table below). Additionally, <em>S. affinis </em>Day, 1963 differs from all its congeners in having paleae and lacking rudimentary notopodia in abdomen and Falkland Island specimen differs in having dorsal crest between chaetigers 3 and 4 (although indistinct, best noticeable after staining). The presence of dorsal crest also suggest affiliation with genera <em>Melinnampharete</em> Annenkova, 1937 and <em>Eusamythella</em> Hartman, 1971 (<em>Eusamythella</em> is considered a synonym of<em> Melinnampharete </em>by Jirkov, 2011), but within this group, FI specimen would also represent a new species given its much higher number of abdominal uncinigers, lack of paleae and the presence of rudimentary notopodia in abdomen. The generic placement of FI specimen is clearly tentative at present. Greater number of specimens is desirable in order to formally describe this species. Further, another species placed in this genus<em> Samythella</em> sp. 2 has been encountered in this study (see Remarks section for <em>Samythella</em> sp. 2 and comparative table below).</p>

A large, robust species; vouchers incomplete, 2 large and 1 smaller specimens, 6-15mm long and 2-2.8mm wide for 35, 39 and 24 segments; thorax anteriorly wide, dorsoventrally flattened, narrowing posteriorly; abdomen cylindrical. Colour in alcohol dark yellow with brown inter-segmental patches mid-dorsally starting in between chaetigers 7-8 to 25-26; body segments narrow, crowded in abdomen.                                                                                                                                     Prostomium short, conical, sharp. Branchiae from chaetiger 5 in smaller specimens or 6 in larger ones , continuing to the end of the fragments; strap-like, triangular, progressively increasing in size.<br />
	Thorax divided into anterior (chaetigers 1-11 in larger specimens and 1-10 in smaller ones) and posterior regions (chaetigers 12-16 and 11-15 respectively), categorised by spines in neuropodia, with ventral papillae. Notopodia of anterior thoracic region with elongated, slightly basally swollen bulbous postchaetal lobes and dense crenulated capillaries (long and short). Neuropodia of anterior thoracic region low lobes with a single row of large (up to 8), triangular podial papillae, with a single row of crenulated capillaries and 6 rows of modified spines; spines thick, short, distally bent, with transverse ridges, yellow to brown in colour. Notopodia of posterior thoracic region similar to preceding chaetigers; neuropodia of posterior thoracic region with 5 robust, dark yellow to light brown, protruding spines with enlarged, blunt, distal tip (not forming pronounced spear-head shape as in P. felix), in addition also modified spines of preceding segments (located ventrally to the large spines) and single row of crenulated capillaries. Ventrum of posterior thoracic region with ventral papillae (in addition to similar podial papillae in neuropodia), increasing in number from 1 (in ch. 12) to 6 to ~10.<br />
	Abdomen from chaetiger 16 or 17; with ventral papillae on chaetigers 17-21 (16-17 in small specimens), reducing in number from ~ 10 to 4 then 1 by chaetiger 21. Abdominal notopodia with lobe (similar to those in thorax), notopodia connected by low dorsal crests; long, slender, inter-ramal cirrus present. Neuropodia with barrel-shaped, distally notched lobes; small triangular ventral cirrus present. Notochaetae long, thin, serrated capillaries and furcate chaetae. Neurochaetae very few long capillaries (often broken off). Ventral papillae absent. Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> This species can be distinguished from <em>Phylo felix</em> in having 4 segments in posterior thoracic region (not 8-9), smaller number of neuropodial papillae in thorax with ~ 6 (not ~15), the presence of ventral papillae in up to 6 anteriormost abdominal chaetigers (as opposed to absent in abdomen). The smaller FI specimen is very similar to <em>Phylo felix heterosetosa </em>described by Hartmann-Schröder (1965) from Chile. In larger vouchers some variation occurs in that branchiae are present from chaetiger 6 (not 5). Also there are 11 segments in anterior thoracic region (not 10), the spines are clearly protruding well beyond the body wall in FI specimens and ventral papillae cover larger number of chaetigers.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution.</strong> Chile, Falkland Islands in slope depths (~1000m).</p>

<p><strong><em>Samythella </em></strong><strong>sp. 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher.</strong> ENDEAVOUR: station E6FA</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong>  Voucher is the only specimen collected in this study; a complete specimen, small and slender, body tapering posteriorly; pale yellow in alcohol; length 4.5mm, width 0.6mm (at widest point of the thorax). Thorax composed of 15 chaetigers, of these 12 uncinigers; abdomen with 17 uncinigers. Prostomium wide, pentagonal shaped lobe; without glandular ridges or eyespots.  Buccal tentacles not observed. Paleae absent. Three pairs of branchiae, inserted in a transverse row on a ridge; two groups separated by a median gap; branchial styles long, cylindrical, smooth but with ventral surface of the innermost branchiae ridged (visible only after staining).  Anterior notopodia well developed, without cirri. Notochaetae few, smooth, narrowly limbate. Thoracic uncini with 5 teeth above rostral tooth and basal prow arranged in a single vertical row; tori without cirri. Abdominal uncinigers very long with rudimentary notopodia.  Abdominal uncini with many small teeth, arranged in 4 regular horizontal rows. Pygidium with 6 short, fleshy, rounded lobes with the 2 dorsal ones largest and 2 ventral ones smallest.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Characters of taxonomic importance in genus <em>Samythella </em>are summarised in remarks section of another species encountered in this study as <em>Samythella</em> sp. 1.  The two FI species (each represented by one specimen only) are very similar, differing primarily in size and number of abdominal uncinigers. <em>Samythella</em> sp. 1 represents a larger species with 27 abdominal uncinigers and indistinct (but upon staining detectable dorsal ridge between thoracic chaetigers 3 and 4), while <em>Samtyhella </em>sp. 2 possess only 17 abdominal uncinigers and no ridge has been detected. The two species also differ in a form of abdominal uncini, in lateral view, the basal prow appears quadrate  in <em>Samythella</em> sp.1  and rounded in <em>Samythella</em> sp. 2 (see Plates for each species).  Samythella sp. 2 represents a new species, given the combination of characters such as number abdominal uncinigers and number and form and ventral cirri (see comparative table for known species of <em>Samythella</em>).</p>

<p><strong><em>Apistobranchus </em>sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. Sea Lion: station 65MFC.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Voucher incomplete, curled, 6mm long and 1mm wide for 40 chaetigers. Body broad, flattened across thoracic region, tapering posteriorly, abdominal segments longer, cylindrical; colour in alcohol dark yellow to orange.</p>
<p>Prostomium bluntly rounded, wider than long, continuing posteriorly as short caruncle terminating in middle of chaetiger 1; pair of short grooved palps (often missing) lateral to caruncle; eyes absent; paired nuchal organs prominent, located posterior to the origin of palps. Peristomium greatly reduced to lips surrounding mouth.</p>
<p>Notopodia reduced to erect, branchiae-like lobes with internal acicula, present on chaetigers 2-6, then absent on chaetigers 7-10, then continuing to end of fragment. Chaetigers 1-6 with basally thick, distally tapering inter-ramal cirrus; neuropodia from 7th chaetiger modified, with dense fascicles of pointed neurochaetae. Neuropodia adorned with various lobes and cirri arise as follows: chaetigers 1-3 with single, triangular lobe at ventral-most edge of neuropodium, chaetiger 4 with 2 lobes on raised ridge, chaetigers 5-6 with thin membranous lamella with numerous (>30) very small papillae, chaetiger 7 with 10 large triangular lobes (5-7 in smaller specimens). Neuropodia of chaetigers 8-11 resembling those of chaetigers 5-6; subsequent (abdominal) neuropodia reduced to long, narrow lobes with few long neurochaetae.</p>
<p>Neurochaetae of first 7 chaetigers somewhat stout with simple, gently bent blunt tips; arranged in 4-6 (irrespective of size) palisaded rows; abdominal neurochaetae capillaries with thin slender tips, about 8 per fascicle with ventralmost group short and dorsalmost group very long. Pygidium (based on additional small, but complete specimen) a simple wide ring, with one median and 2 lateral cirri.</p>
<p><strong>Methyl Green stain patern: </strong>Stain retained in prostomium and peristomium, with the anterior part of peristomium staining strongest, chaetiger 1-4 do not retain stain, chaetigers 5-10 stain lightly inter-ramally, from chaetiger 12 until end of the fragment with stain concentrating on the posterior edge of the neuropodial lamellae; no patterns of dorsum or ventrum detected.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong>. This species belongs to a group in which notopodia are missing on chaetigers 7-10 and neuropodium on chaetiger 4 is multilobed with 2- 3 lobes in this case. FI species is clearly different from two <em>Apistobranchus</em> species known from the area.<em> A. glacierae </em>Hartman, 1978 has notopodia on all segments, while in A. <em>gudrunae</em> Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt, 1988 reported notopodia missing on segment 8 only.</p>
<p>However it is difficult to distinguish FI specimens from <em>A. ornatus </em>Hartman, 1965 redescribed by Blake (1996) from the Pacific, which in turn is difficult to distinguish from <em>A. typicus</em> (NW Atlantic distribution) other than by methyl green stain (see discussion in Blake, 1996).  Falkland Island specimen do not stain uniformly as Blake (1996) reported for <em>A. ornatus</em> and no paired ventral line extending from chaetiger 7-8 has been detected in FI specimens. Additionally, when comparing specimen of similar size, some subtle differences between FI specimens and <em>A. ornatus</em> can be detected and these are summarized in Table 1.  Overall the FI specimens are smaller than <em>A</em>. <em>ornatus</em>, with fewer rows of neurochaetae and fewer lobes on chaetigers 4. We suggest that there is evidence that FI specimens represent new species, which requires formal description.</p>

<p>Prostomium simple, broadly triangular, with short paired nuchal slits, without incision, glandular ridges or eyespots.  Paleae very slender  (about as thin as following notochaetae, gradually tapering to hairlike tips ; very long, surpassing the prostomium.  Four pairs of branchiae, arranged on raised ridge, branchial groups separated by small median gap; styles mostly missing, one apparently regenerating style very thin, smooth, cirriform.</p>
<p>Notopodia with capillary notochaetae, some longer and narrowly limbate capillary chaetae.  Thoracic uncini similar to abdominal uncini with crest of numerous teeth above rostral tooth and basal prow. First abdominal unciniger with dermal fold across dorsum, bearing 4 smooth, foliose lobes with median lobes being larger than lateral ones. Rudimentary notopodia and glandular pads in abdominal uncinigers absent.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong><em>Tanseimaruana </em>sp. 1 represents a new species of this genus, which currently contains two species -  type species <em>T. vestis </em>(Hartman, 1965) from deep waters off New England, Atlantic Ocean and <em>T. boninensis</em>, from deep waters off Chichijima Island in the Pacific Ocean. As its congeners, FI species shares prostomium without incisions or glandular ridges, with nuchal slits, segment II with paleae, 14 thoracic uncinigers and first abdominal unciniger with 4 dorsal foliose lobes. However it can be distinguished from the other species in arrangement of branchiae, which lie on a raised ridge in FI specimen, but are separated by a large median gap in the other species. However better preserved specimens as well as greater number of specimens are needed in order to fully characterise this species.</p>

<p><strong><em>Fabricinuda</em></strong><strong> sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher specimens. Sea Lion: </strong>Stations 1MFC, 1MFA, 49MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Voucher complete specimen; body length 9mm plus 3mm for branchial crown; width at fourth chaetiger level 0.25mm; body very narrow, cylindrical, thread-like; preserved specimens white to pale yellow. Tube present in some specimens , loose (easily broken down), muddy with some particles incorporated. All specimens with eight thoracic and three abdominal chaetigers ; chaetigers 12 shortest about as wide than long; chaetigers 38 much longer than wide, increasing length posteriorly; chaetiger 9 slightly shorter than 8; remaining abdominal chaetigers successively shorter, chaetiger 11 wider than long.</p>
<p>Branchial crown (missing in majority of examined specimens) present in voucher; with three pairs of radioles; distal ends filamentous. Dorsal lips and ventral lips not confirmed under stereomicroscope observation. Vascularized ventral filamentous appendages absent. Branchial hearts present .</p>
<p>Peristomium with 1- 2 pairs of black, crescentic eyes;  narrow and long dorsal median lobe; ventral lobe smaller (less than ½ of dorsal lobe), anterior margin of anterior peristomial ring as a low ridge of even height ventrally, markedly notched laterally rounded lobe to either side of dorsal midline, not overlapping the higher middorsal conical lobe .</p>
<p></p>
<p>Collar chaetae - few narrow hooded chaetae; superior thoracic notochaetae elongate, narrowly hooded, around 5-8 per fascicle; inferior thoracic notochaetae of chaetigers 38 bearing 3 pseudospatulate chaetae . Thoracic uncini acicular; 78 per fascicle arranged in double rows in chaetigers 1-4  in voucher specimen (in other specimens forming a single irregular row), from chaetigers 5 blending into single, if irregular row ; dark yellow to light brown in colour with large secondary tooth oblique to main fang ; apical teeth slender and slightly decreasing in size towards tip of uncinus; small hood present.</p>
<p>Abdominal neuropodia with few very elongate, narrowly hooded chaetae.</p>
<p>Abdominal uncini with about 10 rows of teeth in profile, 4-5 teeth per row; manubrium about the same length as dentate region, slightly expanded proximally; number of uncini per fascicle slightly decreasing posteriorly.</p>
<p>Pygidium conical, longer than chaetiger 11, with pair of black pygidial eyes situated in posterior fourth of pygidium.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> This is only third species of family Fabriciidae from the Southern Ocean or Magellan region. The other two known species <em>Novofabricia chilensis </em>Hartmann-Shroder, 1962 from Chile and <em>Raficiba barryi</em> Fitzhugh, 2001 from Antarctica belong to different genera because of the structure of anterior ventral collar as well as other characters (see Fitzhugh 2001, Huang et al. 2011 for details).  The reduced collar all around combined with the presence of inferior pseudospatulate chaetae in chaetigers 3-7/ 8 place FI specimens into genus <em>Fabricinuda</em> Fitzugh, 1990.  However some characters linked to branchial crown such dorsal and ventral lips are currently not confirmed. This is a first record of genus<em> Fabricinuda</em> from the geographic area investigated here and likely represent a new species. Of the known species (see Fitzhugh 1990, Fitzhugh 2002, Lopez and Rodríguez 2008), FI species is similar to <em>Fabricinuda pseudopalpa </em>Fitzhugh, 1990 and <em>F. longilabrum</em> Fitzhugh, 2002 in lacking ventral filamentous appendages<strong>.</strong> <em>Fabricinuda longilabrum</em> can be further distinguished  from FI species by having the anterior peristomial ring distinctly longer than wide <em>and  F. pseudopalpa</em> can be distinguished by possessing middorsal lobes which can range from small and lobe-like to elongate and palp-like and the anterior end of the body being light to dark brown. The other five described species of the genus, <em>F.</em> <em>limnicola</em><em>, </em><em>F. bikinii</em> (Hartman, 1954<em>), </em><em>F. trilobata</em> (Fitzhugh, 1983), <em>F. pseudocollaris</em> Fitzhugh, 1990 and <em>F. rosaelenae </em>López & Rodríguez, 2008 can be readily distinguished by having unbranched, vascularized ventral filamentous appendages in their branchial crowns and lack of dorsal lips.</p>

<p><strong><em>Ampharete</em></strong><strong> Malmgren, 1866</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Ampharete</em></strong><strong> sp.1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>LOLIGO station: L3FB</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.  </strong>Voucher specimen is the only example of this species collected; specimen complete (branchial styles missing), small but robust species with enlarged thorax, tapering posteriorly, 5.5mm long and 0.6mm wide; colour in alcohol pale yellow. Thorax composed of paleae bearing segment and 14 thoracic chaetigers, of which 12 uncinigers; abdomen with 13 uncinigers. Prostomium  trilobed, with large square-shaped middle lobe delimited by incision from lateral lobes, without glandular ridges or eyes. Buccal tentacles papillose. Paleae present; few (often broken off), long (reaching the anterior margin of prostomium), stout, narrowing rapidly into very long thing tips; yellow in colour. Four pairs of branchiae (all styles missing); 3 pairs of branchiae arranged in transverse line, separated by wide median gap, 4th pair shifted posteriorly, tightly attached between 2nd outermost and innermost branchiae of transverse row. Notopodia with limbate capillary notochaetae. Thoracic uncini with 6 teeth in 2 vertical rows over basal prow and rostral tooth; thoracic uncini of the last two thoracic unciniger resembling those of abdomen. Abdominal uncini small, with several rows of small teeth. First 5 abdominal uncinigers with dorsal cirri, cirrus of 1<sup>st</sup> AU small globular, of AUs 2-5 distinct, digiform.  Pygidium with several irregular small lobes and a pair of prominent, medium length lateral cirri.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Genus <em>Ampharete</em> sensu Jirkov (2001, 2009, 2011) includes species with or without paleae, with four pairs of smooth branchiae, papillose buccal tentacles, 13/14 thoracic chaetigers (excluding paleae) provided with notochaetae and 11/12 thoracic uncinigers.  Species most similar to FI specimen (4 pairs of branchiae, paleae bearing segment plus 14 thoracic chaetigers, of which 12 uncinigers and 13 abdominal uncinigers) are relatively few in this otherwise species rich genus and none are known from the geographical area considered here. This group contains boreal species <em>A. finmarchica</em> and <em>A. acutifrons</em> (Atlantic and Pacific forms likely represent different species; see Hilbig in Blake et al. 1996) which both possess rudimental notopodia in anterior abdominal segments and <em>A. finmarchica</em> also lacks gap between the branchial groups. In FI species rudimental notopodia are absent, but distinct globular to digiform dorsal cirrus is present in neuropodia of AU 1-5.  The commonly reported Southern Ocean species <em>Ampharete kerguelensis </em>has branchiae inserted all in 1 row, rather than in 3 + 1 arrangement and has only 12 abdominal uncinigers. <em>Ampharete labrops</em> from shallow waters of California is also similar, but its upper lip has a band of eyespots. Falkland Island specimens likely represent a new species, but greater number of specimens is desirable in order to provide a full description of this species.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher specimen</strong>. Sea Lion: Station 38MFB, Station 44MFA</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong> Vouchers are complete specimens 12-14 mm long, 0.8-0.9mm wide, for about 106-110 segments. Colour in alcohol opaque, white to light tan, sometimes dots of brown-reddish pigment on body segments. Body robust, thick, dorso-laterally flattened anteriorly, with numerous crowded segments, narrowing posteriorly.<br />
	Prostomium short wider than long, partially fused to peristomium. Antenna very short, clavate, arising from the posterior part of prostomium, reaching anterior margin of first chaetiger; eyes absent; pair of nuchal organs originating from posterior margin of prostomium, extending anteriorly as oblique slits nuchal slits, sometimes with dark pigment. Lateral lips of mouth formed by peristomium; posterior lip formed by chaetigers 1-2.<br />
	Branchiae from chaetiger 4, 16 pairs in voucher specimen, but can be variable; all branchiae except last few similar in size, very short (extending half way to dorsal midline), last few about half that length; each narrow, often narrowing to short, blunt terminal papilla.<br />
	Notopodial postchaetal lobes of chaetigers 1-3 shorter than following; those of branchial region longer, digitate somewhat inflated at the base, each about one-half as long as branchiae; lobes in postbanchiale segments becoming slender and long.<br />
	Capillary setae present in all parapodia becoming much longer in postbranchial segments; modified neurosetae from chaetigers 27 and 28 in two voucher specimens (this varies with size), each thick (stem somewhat bulging in the middle), can appear striated with yellow hues, distally curved, lacking arista, at first only one spine present, then increasing in number with up to 8 in posterior segments; accompanied by very fine capillaries. Pygidium collar-like segment with 1 short terminal cirrus and 2 long thin lateral ones.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> <em>Aricidea simplex</em> is very distinctive, and easily recognized by its thick, robust body, short head with the rounded prostomium, short antenna, and robust curved neuropodial spines. In specimens stained with Rose Bengal there are often distinct red stripes in the ventral anterior chaetigers. Preserved specimens are also often dorsally arched.<br />
	There appears to be some discrepancy when it comes to length of branchiae between South African and Pacific specimens. Day (1963, 1967) described anterior branchiae as overlapping at midline, however Blake (1996) noted that all branchiae are short (reaching half way to midline). Further there appear to be some differences in structure of spines, with Pacific specimens having shorter, stubbier and more strongly curved spines than those pictured by Day (1967). Specimens collected from FI agree well with Blake (1996) description in possessing short branchiae and robust, well curved spines. It is possible that they are actually different species but this requires examination of material from a range of localities which is beyond the scope of the present study.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution. </strong>Apparently widespread but see Remarks above, found in outer shelf to lower continental slope depths 100¬3000+ m: South Africa; Uruguayan shelf; Patagonian shelf; Scotia Sea; Southern Ocean; New Zealand slope; Bering Sea; Japan; Caroline Islands; California, Falkland Islands.</p>

<p><strong><em>Amphicteis</em></strong><strong> Grube, 1850</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Amphicteis </em></strong><strong>sp. 1 </strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher.</strong> Sea Lion: station 46MFB</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.   </strong>Voucher is a complete specimen, 14.5mm and 1.2mm. Thorax consists of paleae bearing segment and 17 chaetigers, 14 of these uncinigers; abdomen with 15 uncinigers. Notopodia with capillary chaetae and globular ventral cirrus, present in 17 chaetigers; anterior notopodia smaller, increasing in size from first to fourth pair. Abdominal uncinigers with rudimentary notopodia with rounded distal lobe, abdominal tori with prominent cirriform dorsal cirrus.</p>
<p><span>Prostomium without paired longitudinal ridges; the middle lobe anteriorly with wide shallow depression, forming short anterolateral horns; paired nuchal ridges straight, well separated by a median gap, arranged at wide angle. Very small pair of light brown eyes present, positioned next to nuchal ridges. Paleae present, pale yellow in colour, 8 per fascicle, extremely long (well past the anterior end of prostomium), stout, slightly curving and gradually tapering into long, thin tip. Buccal tentacles not observed. Four pairs of cirriform branchiae in 2 transverse rows in segments III and IV (forming 2+2 square arrangement), separated by a median gap; branchial styles mostly missing, only 2 present in voucher (on left hand side), both smooth, cylindrical to somewhat flattened (but not truly lamellate), with horizontal striation throughout their length, tapering into blunt tip.</span></p>
<p>Notochaetae arranged in two groups about 4-5 long, limbate, smooth capillaries with thin tips and similar but much shorter ones. Neuropodial tori with uncini, first and second torus particularly enlarged and producing into short tips dorsally and ventrally, housing around 100 uncini, tori of subsequent uncinigers getting smaller, rounded, posterior thoracic tori housing around 50 uncini. Both thoracic and abdominal uncini with 5 teeth over basal prow in lateral view (although in frontal view some teeth are doubled), rostral tooth not observed. Pygidium with terminal anus and two lateral cirri.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong>. Falkland Island specimens are here asigned to the genus <em>Amphicteis</em>, although the longitudinal ridges on prostomium were not observed. The other <em>Amphicteis</em>-like genera  - <em>Phyllamphicteis </em>Augener, 1918 (two of four pairs of branchiae lamellate, <em>Paramphicteis</em> Caullery, 1944 (no paleae) and <em>Pseudoamphicteis </em>Hutchings, 1977 (papillose buccal tentacles) are junior synonyms of <em>Amphicteis</em> according to Jirkov (2001). Genus <em>Jugamphicteis</em> Fauchald & Hancock, 1981 lacks longitudinal ridges, but it is also characterised by the presence of fan-like extension on first abdominal segment, which is absent in Falklands specimens.</p>
<p><em>Amphicteis </em><em>chilensis</em> Hartmann-Schröder, 1965 is very similar to Falkland Island specimens, but not all characters (such as shape of branchiae) can be varifed as these are missing in all Falkland Island specimen other than voucher, in which only two branchiae are present, others are missing, further not all characters mentioned here were imaged or described by  Hartmann-Schröder, 1965. The most noticable difference is in the shape of anterior marging of prostomium, this is concave (with wide shallow depression, forming short anterolateral horns) in FI specimens, while in <em>A. chilensis </em>appears to be convex from the shallow mid depression (Hartmann-Schröder, 1965: p. 247, Fig. 245), dorsum is smooth not annulated as in <em>A. chilensis</em> and additionally rostral tooth in uncini were not observed in Falkland Island specimens and dorsal cirrus in abdominal notopodia is longer. It is probable that Falkland Island specimens represent a new species.</p>

<p><strong><em>Aricidea (Allia)</em> cf.<em> ramosa</em> Annenkova, 1934*</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher specimen.</strong> Sea Lion: Station 54MFB</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.  </strong>Voucher incomplete specimen with around 60 segments (body is posteriorly coiled and segments are impossible to count and exact measurement difficult to obtain), around 10mm long, 0.4 mm wide; colour in alcohol white; body dorsoventrally flattened anteriorly, cylindrical posteriorly, posterior part of the body coiled.<br />
	Prostomium weakly pear-shaped, narrowing anteriorly, nuchal grooves oblique, directed anteriorly. Antenna short, wide base with 5 branches, each branch simple (not branched); eyes absent. Posterior lip of mouth on ventrum of chaetiger 1 and partially on chaetiger 2. Branchiae from chaetiger 4, 17 pairs in voucher specimen, anterior branchiae (1-4 pairs) very wide, just meeting at middline with their tips, pairs 5- 9 getting longer with produced tips, posterior branchiae (pairs 10-12) longest, more slender, with very pronounced elongated tips, the most posterior branchiae slender, reducing in size with the last pair only slightly longer and thicker than corresponding notopodial postchaetal lobe. <br />
	Notopodial postchaetal lobes of chaetigers 1-2 small, becoming larger, cirriform with slightly inflated base from chaetiger 3 through branchial region, thereafter long, thin, cirriform. Neuropodial postsetal lobes inconspicuous.<br />
	Notochaetae capillaries, most dense with thick, curved capillary setae in branchial region; neurosetae thicker than notosetae; postbranchial notosetae thinner and straighter; neurosetae of same segments about as thick as in branchial region but shorter, becoming transformed into modified setae in the region of chaetigers 30-40 (impossible to determine exactly due to some damage and coiling of the body); modified setae straight or curved, bearing elongated terminal spine; 4 per fascicle in posterior part of the body; several thin capillaries accompany modified setae. Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> <em>Aricidea ramosa</em> can be readily distinguished by the presence of branched antenna. However given its cosmopolitan distribution, it is possible that more species lumped under this name are present. For example Strelzov (1973) described some branches of prostomial antenna being distally dichotomous not entire. Types of Annenkova have been lost according to Strelzov (1973). Until careful morphological examination of specimens form type locality accompanied by molecular studies is possible, we prefer to assign FI specimens to <em>Aricidea (Allia) </em>cf. <em>ramosa.</em></p>

<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>VINSTON WEST: station 2MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.  </strong>Voucher is the only example of this species collected in this study; specimen incomplete, damaged; anterior fragment 9mm long and 0.8mm wide (at the widest part of thorax). Single pair of emergent postbranchial hooks present, but tips broken off.  Eighteen thoracic chaetigers, 14 of these uncinigers. Pygidium unknown.</p>
<p>Prostomium is a large square shaped lobe, anteriorly with side shallow depression; with two prominent patches of many golden brown eyespots. Dorsum of chaetiger 4 with a narrow membranous fold with serrated free margin, with 10 blunt, sub-triangular serrations of similar size.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Falkland Island specimens from shallower depth agreed well with <em>Melinna arnaudi</em> Parapar and San Martín (1997), however this specimen clearly represent a different species. It differs from <em>M. arnaudi</em> by presence of eyes, shape of prostomium, form of tube and form of thoracic uncini (these are arranged in a single row, without any teeth which are doubled in <em>M. arnaudi</em>). Given the rather poor condition of the specimen and the fact that <em>Melinna</em> species from the area were often lumped under the northern European <em>M. cristata</em>, it would be desirable to collect a larger number of well-preserved specimens and carry out a revision of this genus in the region.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher Specimen.</strong> Inflex: Station 5MFA</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong> A small to moderate-sized, long species; voucher specimen incomplete with 112 segments, 18 mm long and 0.3 mm wide; body narrow, slightly expanded in prebranchial region somewhat dorsally flattened in branchial region, cylindrical posteriorly.<br />
	Prostomium conical, longer than wide; eyes absent; nuchal organs consisting of 2 short longitudinal slits in the middle of prostomium.<br />
	Branchiae from chaetiger 8, 14 pairs (in voucher), first branchial pair rather short with blunt tips, but later pairs getting long tapering distally into acute tips .<br />
	Notopodial postsetal lobes short in prebranchial segments, getting longer and cirriform with slightly inflated base in branchial region, becoming very thin in postbranchial regions. Neuropodial postchaetal lobes not observed.<br />
	Capillary chaetae of noto- and neurochaetae of prebranchial and branchial regions longest and most dense; postbranchial capillaries thinner and shorter. Modified neurochaetae appear from about chaetiger 25 (in voucher specimen) as a single unidentate spine with well-developed hood on convex side, increasing in number up to 6 per fascicle in posterior segments; size, shape and degree of curvature of spines highly variable within fascicle, usually 2 short heavily curved spines and 4 longer, gently curved spines present; modified neurochaetae accompanied by 2 slender capillaries. Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong><em> Levinsenia acutibranchiata</em> was described by Strelzov (1973) and distinguished from cosmopolitan<em> Levinsenia gracilis</em> by branchiae tapering into acute tips in<em> L. acutibranchiata</em> but blunt in<em> L. gracilis</em>. This feature has also been found in FI specimens. Strelzov (1973) also pointed to differences in notopodial lobes and shape of spines, but the second character appears to be rather variable in<em> L. gracilis</em> to be of value as evident from the images in Strelzov (1973). Additionally subspecies<em> L. gracilis minuta</em> with branchiae with acute tips was described by Hartmann-Schöder (1965) from Chile. Strelzov in his revision (1973) considered her specimens to belong to<em> L. gracilis</em>, he did not comment on the character of branchiae with acute tips and the similarity to<em> L. acutibranchiata</em>. Without access to Chilean specimens of Hartmann-Schröder and Uruguayan specimens of Strelzov, it is difficult to say if these two species are conspecific. We have opted to identify the FI material as Strelzovs species until this issue is resloved.</p>

<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>Sea Lion: station 7MFC</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Voucher is a complete specimen, 7.5mm long and 0.5mm wide. Thorax consists of paleae bearing segment and 14 chaetigers, 12 of these uncinigers; abdomen with 12 uncinigers.  Whitish, circular band  anterior to notopodia of TU-2 (stains strongly red using Shirla stain), additionally stain shows ventral only band on TU-1. First and second notopodia reduced, the modified notopodia on TU-8 slightly shifted dorsally and connected with low glandular ridge.</p>
<p>Prostomium  <em>Ampharete-</em>type, trilobed, without glandular ridges.  Paleae present, about 15 per fascicle, longer than most developed notochaetae, pale yellow in colour, flat, stout, gradually tapering into long, thin tip.</p>
<p>Four pairs of branchiae in 3 + 1 arrangement; three anterior pairs are arranged in a row on a raised ridge, the 4th pair tightly attached posteriorly to innermost and median pair; styles of branchiae missing; all branchiophores of equal size.</p>
<p>Notochaetae in two rows throughout the thorax, one row consist of 6-7 long, smooth, narrowly limbate capillaries and second row consists of similar, but shortened chaetae; in modified notopodia of TU-8 limbate notochaetae similar, but tapering into very long, thin tip. Thoracic uncini, tiny; abdominal uncini with 7 (5 large and two distalmost very small) teeth in lateral view.  Abdominal segments without rudimental notopodia or neuropodial cirri. Pygidium a small, narrow cone, no cirri observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Genus <em>Anobothrus </em>has been a subject of recent reviews worldwide (Jirkov, 2008) and regionally concentrating on Southern Ocean and South American waters (Schüller and Jirkov, 2013), with some new species discovered in the process, many of those from deep waters. Characters of those species are summarized in Table accompanying this description. Only two species know from the region share a character of circular band anterior to TU-2, both deep-water species. Of these, <em>A. rubropalaetus </em>differs in possessing long, red paleae (colour visible even in preserved specimens) while <em>A. wilhelmi </em>has all 4 pairs of branchiae arranged in single row, with two outermost pairs reduced in size. Outside the geographical area only deep-water, boreal species <em>A. laubieri </em>has circular band anterior to TU-2, but it only possesses 3 pairs of branchiae. Falkland Island specimens currently assigned morphospecies <em>Anobothrus</em> sp. 1 represent new species and will be formally described.</p>

<p><strong><em>Aonidella cirrobranchiata</em></strong><strong> (Day, 1961) <em>sensu</em> López, 2010</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>Vinson West: Station 1MFA , Endeavour: Station E4FB</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Two incomplete vouchers are the only examples of this species collected; both anterior fragments with 14 and 16 chaetigers, 3.5mm long and 0.6mm wide.</p>
<p>Prostomium broad, entire, anteriorly truncated, posterior margin of prostomium not discernable as completely fused with dorsum; occipital antenna absent; eyes not observed. Peristomium separated from prostomium, not well developed.</p>
<p>Branchiae present, but easily lost (completely missing in one specimen), small scars at the bases of notopodial lamellae of chaetiger 2 suggest branchiae start form chaetiger 2, but missing; initially branchiae smaller than corresponding notopodial lamellae, becoming longer (twice the length of the corresponding lamellae in chaetiger 10), cirriform; presence of branchiae (scars not observed) not confirmed past chaetiger 10.  Both notopodial and neuropodial postchaetal lobes are small, short and tapering, except for notopodial lamellae on chaetiger two these are at least twice the size of those on other segments and more pigmented. Notochaetae present only in 16 chaetigers long fragments. Modified chaetae, dorsal crest, genital pouches and pygidium not observed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Supplementary diagnosis.</strong> Additional specimen has been examined from another collection around Falkland Islands as part of taxonomic standardization exercise. This specimen was a longer anterior fragment of 27 chaetigers and presence of bidentate hooded hooks was confirmed from chaetiger 18; two teeth are widely apart, enclosing a nearly 45 degree angle.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Remarks.</strong> Although only two very short anterior fragments were available for examination the distinctive shape of prostomium allies this species with genus <em>Aonidella</em>. No SEM examination has been undertaken, therefore pits of 6<sup>th</sup> chaetiger cannot be confirmed (see Greaves et al. 2011 and Meißner et al. 2014).</p>
<p>Of the three known species in this genus, only <em>A.</em> <em>insolita</em> (Greaves, Meißner & Wilson, 2011) known from 393m depth in Shark Bay region, Indian Ocean, Australia can be easily distinguished by presence of genital pouches from segment 6. There is an extended discussion of rather subtle taxonomical differences between the other two species  <em>A. dayi</em> López-Jamar, 1989 and <em>A. cirrobranchiata </em>(Day, 1961) presented in López (2010) and Meißner et al. (2014). López (2010) reported <em>Aonidella</em> from the Bellinghausen Sea (first record from the Southern Ocean) and assigned this specimen to South African <em>A.</em> <em>cirrobranchiata</em> (Day, 1961) as well as providing a detailed description of these specimens. The Bellinghausen Sea specimens agree well with Falkland Island specimen, which are therefore assigned here to this species.</p>

<p><strong><em>Levinsenia antarctica</em> (Strelzov, 1973)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher specimen.</strong> Sea Lion: Station 29MFC</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.  </strong>Long and very slender species; voucher specimens incomplete with 51 segments, 8mm long, 0.3mm wide; body cylindrical, thin, of uniform width; colour white to pale yellow in alcohol.<br />
	Prostomium conical, longer than wide, anteriorly rounded, with small terminal papilla; eyes absent; no pigmentation observed; nuchal organs slightly curved slits in middle part of prostomium.<br />
	Branchiae from chaetiger 7, 4 pairs in voucher (but varies from 3 to 5 pairs), all short, particularly first and last pair very short (easily overlooked) about twice as long as wide, middle pairs of branchiae longer, about four times as long as wide, all of similar form with blunt tips.<br />
	Notopodial postchaetal lobes very small, knob-like in prebranchial segments, becoming larger digiform in branchial segments (but still very small about 1/3 of the length of corresponding branchiae), getting thin in postbranchial region. Neuropodial postchaetal lobes not observed.<br />
	Notochaetae always capillaries, longest and dense in anterior part of the body, arranged in single row, not particularly numerous about 10 per fascicle, even fewer in posterior segments. Neurochaetae capillaries similar in form and number to notochaetae, but longer. Modified neurochaetae appear first in chaetiger 17 in voucher specimen as a single, stout, strongly curved (sickle-shaped), straw-coloured to brown spine with unidentate tip and well develop hood on the convex side, these increase to 3 in number in subsequent chaetigers accompanied by two short capillaries, eventually increasing to 5 per fascicle in posterior segments. Pygidium not observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>FI specimens agree well with <em>L. antarctica</em> as described by Strelzov, 1973, although the number of branchiae is more variable 3-5 rather than 3 as reported by Strelzov. This observation agrees with other specimens of this species from Magellan regions as reported by Montiel et al. (2002). Few aberrant specimens agreeing well with <em>L. antarctica,</em> but lacking all branchiae were encountered. Currently, it is assumed that these are damaged specimens in which the branchiae were lost.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution.</strong> Southern Ocean (Kemp coast type locality), Weddell Sea, King George Island, Chile (Beagle Channel and Continental slope off Tierra del Fuego) at 100 1162m, Falkland Islands.</p>

<p><strong><em>Fabricinuda</em> sp. 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>Sea Lion: Station 79MFC.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis. </strong>Voucher complete specimen (branchial crown missing); body length 6mm; width at fourth chaetiger level 0.3mm; body very narrow, cylindrical, thread-like; preserved specimens pale yellow. Body with eight thoracic and three abdominal chaetigers; chaetiger 12 shortest about as wide as long; chaetiger 38 much longer than wide, increasing in length posteriorly; chaetiger 9 slightly shorter than 8; remaining abdominal chaetigers successively shorter, chaetiger 11 wider than long.</p>
<p>Branchial crown missing.  Peristomium with anterior margin of anterior peristomial ring as a low ridge of even height all around, incomplete middorsally not overlapping the higher middorsal conical lobe.  Anterior peristomial ring about as long as wide, ventrally with a large square-shaped pad; peristomial eyes not observed (possibly with a pair of very faint black eyes?).</p>
<p>Collar chaetae as very narrowly hooded capillaries; superior thoracic notochaetae elongate, narrowly hooded, around 5-8 per fascicle; inferior thoracic notochaetae of chaetiger 38 bearing up to 3 pseudospatulate chaetae. Thoracic uncini acicular; 8-9 per fascicle arranged in a single irregular row; dark yellow to light brown in colour with large secondary tooth oblique to main fang; apical teeth slender and slightly decreasing in size towards tip of uncinus; small hood present .</p>
<p>Abdominal neuropodia with few very elongated, narrowly hooded chaetae. Abdominal uncini with about 10 rows of teeth in profile, 5 teeth per row; manubrium about the same length as dentate region, slightly expanded proximally; number of uncini per fascicle slightly decreasing posteriorly to 10 on chaetiger 11.</p>
<p>Pygidium conical, longer than chaetiger 11, pygidial eyes not observed .</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Even though the branchial crown is missing, the characters consistent with genus <em>Fabricinuda</em> Fitzhugh, 1990 were observed, collar present as a low ridge all around, pseudospatulate chaetae present in chaetigers 3-8. This is a second species of<em> Fabricinuda</em> reported from FI material as well as from wider geographical area (Southern Ocean, Magellan region). It differs from <em>Fabricinuda</em> sp. 1 reported from Falkland Islands  in possessing a well-developed collar, lack of peristomial eyes (faint at best if present), lack of pygidial eyes and the presence of square-shaped pad on the ventrum of anterior peristomial collar (this character is unique and has not been reported in any other <em>Fabricinuda</em> species).  This is only the fourth species of Fabriciidae recorded from the Southern Ocean/Magellan region, yet two new species were found from a single sampling effort, suggesting that improved sampling is likely to discover more of these small, thin bodied worms.</p>

<p><strong><em>Anobothrus</em></strong><strong> Levinsen, 1884 </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Anobothrus </em></strong><strong>cf. <em>glandularis </em>Hartmann-Schröder, 1965</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher. </strong>Sea Lion: station 8 MFB</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Voucher is a complete specimen, 10mm long and 1mm wide. Thorax consists of paleae bearing segment and 14 chaetigers, 12 of these uncinigers; abdomen with 13 uncinigers.  Prostomium  <em>Ampharete-</em>type, trilobed, without glandular ridges.  Paleae present, about 15 per fascicle, longer than most developed notochaetae, slender, gradually tapering into long, thin tip. Four pairs of branchiae in 3 + 1 arrangement; three anterior pairs are arranged in a row on a raised ridge, the 4th pair is stand alone, located posterior at the level of notopodia of thoracic chaetiger 2 (the chaetiger following paleae bearing segment); styles of branchiae mostly missing, where present these are long and smooth, cylindrical; branchiophores of  3 anterior pairs of equal size, branchiophore of posterior pairs, smaller, low (can be overlooked). Whitish, circular band  anterior to notopodia of TU-3 (stains strongly red using Shirla stain), additionally stain shows ventral only bands on TU-1 and TU-2. First and second notopodia smaller than in subsequent chaetigers, but not reduced. The modified notopodia on TU-8 slightly shifted dorsally and  connected with low glandular ridge. Notochaetae in two rows throughout the thorax, one row consist of 6-7 long, smooth, narrowly limbate capillaries and second row consists of similar, but shorted chaetae; in modified notopodia of TU-8 limbate notochaetae wider, abruptly tapering into slender tip distally (their surface may appear hirsute under high magnification). Abdominal segments without rudimental notopodia or neuropodial cirri. Pygidium a short, wide cone, dorsally slightly enlarged, no cirri observed.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>Genus <em>Anobothrus </em>has been a subject of recent reviews worldwide (Jirkov, 2008) and regionally concentrating on Southern Ocean and South American waters (Schüller and Jirkov, 2013), with some new species discovered in the process, many of those from deep waters. Characters of those species are summarized in Table accompanying this description. Of the 4 known species of <em>Anobothrus</em> known from the region, which have circular band anterior to TU-3, Falkland specimens agree with <em>A. glandularis</em>, although they differ in number of abdominal segments (12 in <em>A. glandularis</em>, 13 in Falkland specimens), but this character can show variation in other <em>Anobothrus</em> species (see Jirkov, 2011) and position of the posterior 4<sup>th</sup> branchiophore. Until the examination of type specimens of <em>A. glandularis</em> is possible to confirm the identity of Falkland specimens, we prefer to assign the name <em>Anobothrus</em> cf. <em>glandularis</em> at this stage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Laonice </em></strong><strong>sp. 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voucher specimens.  </strong>Sea Lion: Station 26MFC, Station 35MFC, Station 38MFA, Station 52MFA.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Voucher is the largest specimen; incomplete, an anterior fragment 37mm long, 4mm wide for 42 chaetigers. Anterior part of body enlarged and flattened; colour in alcohol off white to yellow.</p>
<p>Prostomium narrow, anteriorly rounded; indistinctly fused with peristomium by a thin membrane (peristomial lateral wings not rising above prostomium); eyes absent or present as only one pair of small red eyes; occipital antenna present, rudimentary, cirriform; caruncle long, continuing posteriorly to chaetiger 15. Palps not observed.</p>
<p>Branchiae from chaetiger 2; small, cirriform at first increasing in length and thickness in subsequent segments; fused to notopodial postchaetal lamella basally; exact number of branchiae impossible to define, since all the specimens are incomplete.</p>
<p>Chaetiger 1 slightly shorter than chaetiger 2, with triangular, short notopodial postchaetal lamellae and rounded neuropodial lamellae; postchaetal lamellae of following chaetigers increasingly larger, triangular and acutely pointed in notopodia, rounded in neuropodia.</p>
<p>Dorsal crests not observed. Neuropodial pouches present; first occurrence varies from segment 6-10, most commonly appearing from segment 7; initially these may be small and translucent (can be easily overlooked) developing into obvious fleshy pouches by segment 10.</p>
<p>Capillaries narrowly limbate, with fine granules imbedded in shaft arranged in two rows in both notopodia and neuropodia throughout. Sabre chaetae, granulated throughout most of its length, present form chaetiger 15, 1-3 per fascicle. Neuropodial hooded hooks present from chaetigers 27 - 31; 8 -10 per fascicle; hooks bidentate (in lateral view) with main fang surmounted by a smaller apical tooth; shaft stout and finely striated.</p>
<p>Pygidium missing in all specimens studied.</p>
<p><strong>Remarks. </strong>This species was very abundant in samples from FI, but its superficial similarity to widespread Southern Ocean species <em>Laonice weddellia</em> in the shape of prostomium and start of genital pouches which might have led to misidentification of this species previously. In fact the presence of <em>Laonice weddellia</em> has not been confirmed in the FI material so far, but it has been recorded by previous faunistic studies (Blake, 1983). As recent taxonomic description (e.g. Lopez 2011 for <em>Laonice vieitezi</em>) shown, the existence of new species could have been easily overlooked in the past. The most important characters which set <em>Laonice</em> sp. 1 apart from <em>Laonice weddellia </em>are: chaetae arranged in two rows only in both rami (it is 4-5 in <em>L. weddellia</em>), and the later start of neuropodial hooks in segments 27-31 (it is 16-25 in <em>L. weddellia</em>), see comparative Tables 1. and 2. for details. Many small specimens, which agreed with Laonice sp. 1 were also recorded and are considered to be juveniles.</p>
