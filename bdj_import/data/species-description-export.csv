		Potamethus Chamberlin, 1919



Potamethus sp. 1
Voucher. Sea Lion: station 40MFB.
Diagnosis. Large species; voucher is the only specimen encountered in this study; complete, with branchial crown; body 35 mm long, crown 17mm long, body 2mm wide; 8 thoracic and 39 abdominal chaetigers; chaetigers very crowded and very wide in posterior abdomen given the specimen somewhat swollen look towards the pygidium; colour in alcohol light tan to pink.
Branchial crown with 8 pairs of radioles, basally connected by a well-developed palmate membrane; radioles with pinnules to the tip; ventral filaments absent.
Collar most developed ventrally with distinctly elongate posterior peristomial ring, laterally and dorsally as a low lobes; dorsally forming two pockets, not overlapping at midline. Peristomial eyes not observed. Glandular ridge on chaetiger 2 present.
Collar uncini limbate notochaetae ranged in longitudinal rows. Thoracic superior notochaetae long, broadly limbate about 10 per fascicles and numerous, shorter mucronate chaetae arranged in 2 rows (around 9 chaetae per row). Thoracic uncini avicular with very long handles, breast as a pronounced swelling, about 14 per fascicle, arranged in single row, each with main fang and 4 small, diminishing in size teeth as seen in profile; with a row of smaller, hooked-shaped companion chaetae.
Abdominal neurochaetae composed of thin capillaries, around 6 per fascicle and row of 6 mucronate chaetae (narrower than thoracic mucronate chaetae); posterior neurochaetae change shape dramatically; in posterior abdominal segments neurochaetae as shorter and longer thickened (almost spine-like) narrowly limbate capillaries with very distinct long, thin mucrons. Abdominal uncini of anterior and mid abdominal chaetigers long handled, similar to thoracic unicni, around 20 per fascicle arranged in single row anterior and mid abdominal segments, reducing in numbers posteriorly.
Pygidium indistinct, very small triangular lobe; pygidial eyes not observed. Fragments of tube observed, composed of fine mud, greyish in colour, smooth without embedded particles.
Remarks. The FI specimen belong to genus Potamethus as they possess a girdle on chaetiger 2, and distinctly elongate posterior peristomial ring of the collar, although the form of thoracic uncini is distinctly avicular not acicular as otherwise common for species with girdle on chaetiger 2. Potamethus scotiae was described from Princess Martha Coast, around 2500m depth by Pixel (1913), however her original description was very brief (concentrating mostly on branchial crown and shape of collar, while at the same time providing drawings for chaetae only) and, therefore, of relatively little value. Nevertheless Pixell (1913) pictured and described only 1 type of abdominal neurochaetae, not 2 as clearly obvious in FI specimens. Knight-Jones (1983) re-examined holotypes and re-defined genus Potamethus. Based on drawings she provided for P. scotiae, the collar is not the same as for the one found in Falkland specimens. Knox and Cameron (1998) also provided description of P. scotiae, this time from the Ross Sea. The collar corresponds well with that of genus Potamethus, but they reported only one type of abdominal neurochaetae, as well as large number of radiolar pairs in comparison to FI specimens (15 versus 8).

Voucher specimens. Sea Lion: stations 67MFA and 25MFC; Inflexible: station 2MFB.
Diagnosis. Large, robust species; body covered by sheath, giving the body a smooth appearance (chaetae not clearly protruding from the body); body cylindrical, gradually tapering posteriorly, without clear division between thorax and abdomen; body segments narrow (much wider than long) and crowded throughout. The largest voucher specimen complete with branchial crown; body 35mm long, branchial crown 15mm long, body width 4mm, body curved into crescent-like shape, colour in alcohol dark yellow; the smallest voucher complete with branchial crown; body 4mm long, branchial crown 3mm long, body width 1 mm; body straight. Thorax with 8 chaetigers, abdomen with 22 or more chaetigers (depending on size).
Large voucher with 13 pairs of radioles fused at the base by a palmate membrane, ventral pair shortest; ventral filaments not observed.
Collar not developed; peristomium reduced dorsally and laterally to ring, ventrally elongated as a broad triangular lobe at the base of radioles; peristomial eyes not observed. Glandular ridge on chaetigers 2 present.
Peristomial chaetae narrowly limbate, arranged in longitudinal row. Thoracic notochaetae arranged as a tuft on very slender narrowly limbate chaetae; thoracic uncini not easily observable in specimens available here. Abdominal neurochaetae, thin capillaries; abdominal uncini very small (difficult to observe), forming nearly complete cinctures around the body, avicular with 2 large teeth.
Pygidium broad conical lobe, not obvious in large specimens; pygidial eyes not observed.
Remarks. Myxicola sulcata is a very distinct species, described from Ross Sea by Ehlers (1912) and considered to have distribution limited to that area (Knox and Cameron, 1998). Reports of this species outside the Ross Sea may represent a different species, however more work would be necessary to establish if FI represent a new species, distinct from M. sulcata.

Desdemona? sp. 1
Voucher. SEA LION: station 3MFC (with branchial crown, non-brooding); station 22 MFA (with branchial crown, brooding) and station 56MFB (branchial crown missing).
Diagnosis (based on voucher from station 3MFC). Small, extremely slender species; voucher is a complete specimen with branchial crown; body 3.8 mm long and 0.15 mm wide, branchial crown is 0.5 mm long; body with 8 thoracic and 15 abdominal segments; posterior thoracic and anterior abdominal segment elongated (much longer than wide); posterior abdominal segments short again; colour in alcohol pale yellow.
Branchial crown with 3 pairs of radioles and 1 pair of shorter non-vascularized ventral filaments; radioles with 5 or possibly 6 pairs of widely separated pinnules.
Collar is well-developed; much higher ventrally (=anterior margin of anterior peristomial ring developed ventrally as wide lobe); low dorsally with two deep dorso-lateral notches; well developed, long, narrow dorsal lip observed.
Glandular ridge on chaetiger 2 present. Peristomial eyes not observed.
Superior thoracic notochaetae long, limbate; inferior thoracic notochaetae short, simple capillaries. Thoracic neurochaetae acicular; with at least 5 teeth decreasing in size above the main fang; reducing in number from 10 in chaetiger 2 to 3 in chaetiger 8 (the last thoracic chaetiger). Abdominal uncini avicular with enlarged breast; the number constant, with 6 in chaetiger 9 and 5 posteriomost chaetigers, but the last one which only bears 1 uncinus. Anterior abdominal uncini extremely small; anterior one very narrow, arranged in about 3 rows (in frontal view), with about 6 teeth per row; posterior uncini broader, arranged in about 5 rows (in frontal view).
Posteriomost chaetigers gradually narrowing into well developed, rounded, triangular to cordiform pygidial lobe, terminal cirrus or pygidial eyespots not observed. Tube not observed.
Reproduction. In several specimens a single small juvenile was found inside the branchial crown and these specimens appear to have longer and perhaps more numerous pinnules on their radioles than voucher from station 3MFS. At present, we assume this to be an adaptation that enables brooding of juveniles. No other morphological differences were observed. Brooding of eggs and larvae within the branchial crown has been linked to small body size and habitat. Of other Sabellidae known from the region, this strategy has been documented in Perkinsiana antarctica (Knight-Jones and Bowden, 1984; Gambi and Patti, 1999) and Myxicola cf. sulcata (Gambi et al., 2001).
Remarks. The small size, relatively low number of abdominal segments, development of collar, lack of inferior mucronate chaetae and form of thoracic and abdominal uncini suggest these Falkland Is. specimens belong to the genus DesdemonaBanse, 1957. However, there are also some inconsistencies, such as lack of peristomial or pygidial eyes and the number of abdominal segments while relatively low is higher (N=15) than in all other know species (up to 8).
This is a small genus, currently with five valid species, all with Southern Hemisphere distribution. Three of these are reported from the area - D. trilobata (with type locality: Falkland Islands), D. nova and D. antarctica. Should the generic identification be confirmed by subsequent work, specimens from Falkland Islands collected here likely represent a new species.
Overview of known Desdemona species:
D. ornata: radioles with dark pigments, collar missing dorsally, with 8 abdominal segments only.
D. trilobata: presence of two pairs of obvious persistomial eyes; only 6 abdominal segments and pair of lateral wings in posteriormost abdominal segments.
D. antarctica: presence of small pair of peristomial eyes, collar with a single dorsal incision only, with 7 abdominal segments only.
D. nova ? 
D. aniara: collar similar to D. antarctica, radioles with 8 pairs of pinnules.

"Claviramus Fitzhugh, 2002"," Claviramus Fitzhugh, 2002
Claviramus sp. 1
Voucher. INFLEX: station 1MFA.
Diagnosis. Small and slender species; voucher specimen complete, with branchial crown; body 2.5mm long, crown 1mm long, body 0.2mm wide; 8  thoracic and 9 abdominal chaetigers.
Branchial crown with 5 pairs of radioles, basally connected by a very low palmate membrane; radiole with papillae, distally ends in a well-developed flange with long filament; 2 pairs of nonvascularized ventral filaments present. (Presence/absence and structure of the lips not determined at this stage).
Collar most developed ventrally as high lobe, low lobe laterally and dorsally as a low lobes; margin smooth with mid-ventral shallow notch; dorsally forming two lobes that just about meet at midline. Peristomial eyes not observed. Glandular ridge on chaetiger 2 present.
Collar uncini limbate notochaetae. Thoracic notochaetae of two types - long, broadly limbate and shorter paleate, about 3 + 3 per fascicle. Thoracic uncini acicular with long handles, breast as a narrow swelling, positioned very close to notochaetae, 3 per fascicle, each with main fang and rows of small, diminishing-in-size teeth covering half the length of main fang. Abdominal uncini appear Jasmineira-like (with reduced breast), main fang surmounted by several rows of small teeth; 4 per fascicle.
Pygidium triangular lobe, pygidial eyes not observed.
Remarks. The flanges on distal ends of radioles a feature clearly observed in FI specimen, are a hallmark of genus Claviramus (Fitzhugh, 2002). However Fitzhugh (2002) also reported abdominal uncini to be avicular, with enlarged breast. While it was not possible to observe abdominal uncini in clear lateral view in FI specimen, these do appear more of Jasmineira type, with reduced breast. This character requires clarification (only a single, very fragile specimen is currently available for examination). Currently, only 3 species of Claviramus are known (none from the geographical area investigated): C. candelus (Grube, 1863) from Adriatic Sea, C. grubei Fitzhugh, 2002 from Thailand and C. oculatus (Langerhans, 1884) from Madeira. The FI specimen represents a new species showing affinities with C. grubei and C. oculatus (sensu Cochrane 2000) in having filamentous ends to radioles distal to the foliaceous flanges (see discussion in Fitzhugh, 2002). It can be further distinguished from C. oculatus by presence of a glandular ridge on chaetiger 2. Claviramus grubei is marked by presence of this glandular ridge, but differs from FI specimens in possessing more abdominal chaetigers (12 versus 9) and greater number of radiolar pairs in branchial crown (7 versus 5), even though the holotypes are of the exact dimension (i.e. differences cannot be size related). This is a first record of genus Claviramus from South America and Southern Ocean.

Eucranta Malmgren, 1866
Eucranta mollis (McIntosh, 1876)
Voucher. Sea Lion: station 6MFA.
Diagnosis. Voucher is a large, complete but fragmented specimen, anterior fragment 14mm long and 3.5mm wide, for 20 chaetigers; reddish-brown pigmentation on dorsum.
Prostomium bilobed, rounded, cephalic peaks not discerned in voucher specimen, lateral antennae inserted ventrally to median antenna; 2 pairs of small eyes, anterior pair of eyes anteroventral. Antennae and cirri tapering, smooth. Parapodia bi-ramous, neuropodial supra-acicular process short.
Elytral margin and surface smooth, except for patch of conical microtubercles near anterior margin. Tip of upper neurochaetae slender, forceps-like; tip of middle and lower neurochaetae mostly bidentate with stout secondary tooth, few lowermost forceps-like.
Remarks. Falkland Island specimens agree well with Eucranta mollis. This species has been recently revised by Barnich et al. 2012 and we refer readers to this publication for details, including comparison with similar species from the region (E. notialis has not been found in Falkland samples, but given its distribution, it is likely to be present).
Distribution. Antarctic and Magellan regions, the continental slope off the northern coast of Argentina, Falkland Islands.

Cirrophorus cf. furcatus  (Hartman, 1957) sensu Strelzov, 1973
Voucher. Sea Lion: Station 41MFC
Diagnosis. Small sized species; voucher specimen is incomplete with 50 segments,  4mm long and 0.5 mm wide; anterior part of the body enlarged and dorsoventrally flattened, cylindrical posteriorly; colour in alcohol reddish brown, with darkest pigmentation in prostomium and prebranchial segments.
Prostomium slightly pear-shaped; prostomial antenna very short (not protruding beyond the prostomium), cirriform, unlike prostomium not stained (contrast well as it appears white against prostomium); nuchal organs present as short slits in posterior part of prostomium, partially covered by peristomium.
Branchiae from chaetiger 4, 19 pairs in voucher specimen (but variable in other specimens), first and last pair shortest, other branchiae long (overlapping at midline), tapering distally into acute tips , the last branchiae (where present) short.
Notopodial postchaetal lobes small, digiform in prebranchial segments, lengthening throughout, longest in mid-branchial region–about half the length of corresponding branchiae, getting small again in posterior segments.
Notochaetae long capillaries, most dense in anterior part of the body, some extremely long and modified lyrate (forked) chaetae, lyrate chaetae from chaetiger 5 (very difficult to observed as notochaetae very dense), becoming obvious from around chaetiger 15, 2 per fascicle; lyrates with unequal tines with long filamentous tips, both with inner edges serrated.  Neurochaetae capillaries only, most dense in anterior part of the body, some extremely long. Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. FI specimens agree most with C. furcatus Strelzov, 1973 descriptions in  size and shape of antenna, branchiae from chaetiger 4 and form of notopodial lobes (very long in branchial segments, getting smaller in postbranchial segments). However, the striking reddish pigmentation was not commented on by Strelzov. Neither was the presence of extremely long capillary noto- and neurochaetae (in addition to shorter ones) observed in FI specimens. Also he noted appearance of lyrate chaetae from chaetiger 3.
Blake (1996) provided a description of C. furcatus from deep water of California, but in his description of the size of notopodial lobes, reducing in size from prebranchial to branchial chaetigers, was in contrast to their description in Strelzov. Given the inconsistencies in characters descriptions and subsequent identification by various authors it is very difficult to arrive at conclusion about the identity of FI specimens without re-examining the type specimens and specimens from other localities. There is also a species of Cirrophorus reported from Southern Ocean–C. brevicciratus Strelov, 1973–which differs from FI specimen in possessing blister-like antenna (not developed in small specimens) and short notopodial lobes in branchial segments.
Additional work will be necessary to confirm if FI specimens with their striking pigmentation, long notopodial lobes in branchial regions and very long capillaries in fact represent a new species. In the meantime we refer the FI offshore material to Cirrophorus cf. furcatus  (Hartman, 1957) (sensu Strelzov, 1973). The reddish pigmentation, which is particularly pronounced in the most anterior body region, makes this species easy to distinguish from all other paranoid species in FI material.

Diagnosis. Small sized, very slender species; voucher is the largest  with 43 segments (incomplete specimen), 6mm long and 0.3mm wide; body of uniform width throughout, segments becoming bead-like in middle and posterior segments; colour in alcohol pale yellow.
	Prostomium triangular, slightly longer than wide, anteriorly blunt; prostomial antenna absent; nuchal organs present as two short slits in posterior part of prostomium.
	Branchiae from chaetiger 4, 5 pairs in voucher specimens (as few as 2 pairs in other specimens), the last pair short (not meeting at midline), the middle branchiae long (overlapping at midline), all with blunt tips.
	Notopodial postchaetal lobes in prebranchial segments small digitiform, smallest in chaetiger 1 then lengthening progressively becoming largest in branchial region with their bases slightly inflated, slender, cirriform in postbranchial region.
	Notochaetae long capillaries, most dense in the anterior part of the body. Modified chaetae lyrate (forked) from chaetiger 6 (very difficult to observe as notochaetae very dense), becoming easy to observe from around chaetiger 9, only one per fascicle, with unequal tines, with long filamentous tips, both tines with inner edges serrated. Neurochaetae capillaries only, most dense in anterior part of the body. Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. Only P. brunnea Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt, 1988 is a known Paradoneis species from the area (Southern Ocean), possessing three prebranchial chaetigers, short blunt form of branchiae, presence of modified lyrate chaetae only (i.e. no spines) in notopodia. However there are also differences in that FI specimens lack the brown pigmentation of P. brunnea, lyrate chaetae occur from chaetiger 6 (rather than 3 in P. brunnea) and possess a much smaller number of branchiae (5 observed versus 12 in P. brunnea).P. forticirrata described by Strelzov (1973) from the deep Pacific Ocean in which first lyrate spines also occur in segment 4-6, but differs in possessing 15-17 pairs of branchiae and most importantly Strelzov described the notopodial postchaetal lobes on prebranchial segments as massive and made this important distinguishing character from other species of Paradoneis (Strelzov 1973, p.147). However, the accompanying drawing in Strelzov (p. 146) does not show large notopodial lobes. These are in fact similar to those found in FI specimens and also described in P. brunnea. A comparative table for known species of Paradoneis was provided by Aguirrezabalaga and Gil (2009).  However, characters such as the number of branchial pairs is variable (probably size dependent) and so we cannot exclude the possibility that, given the small size of FI specimens, they are in fact juveniles of one of these species. Additional work will be necessary to confirm if FI specimens in fact represent a new species or merely a juvenile form.

Voucher specimen. Inflex: Station 1MFB.
Diagnosis. Moderately sized species; voucher incomplete 10.5mm long and 1mm wide for 35 chaetigers; thorax anteriorly wide, dorsoventrally flattened, narrowing posteriorly; abdomen cylindrical. Colour in alcohol dark yellow.
	Prostomium, short, sharply conical. Thorax with 11 chaetigers; branchiae from chaetiger 6 until end of fragment, strap-like, wide basally, narrowing into thin tip distally (Plate 1a). Notopodial postchaetal lobes with slender digitate-triangular lobe, getting progressively longer over the first 5 chaetigers. Thoracic notochaetae crenulated capillaries. Thoracic neurochaetae modified spines only; thick, short, distally bent, with blunt tip with transverse ridges, straw-coloured, arranged distinctly in 4 rows.
	Abdomen from chaetiger 12. Notopodial lobe similar to ones in thorax. Inter-ramal cirrus absent. Neuropodial postchaetel lobes robust, distally somewhat bi-lobed with one short, blunt lobe and one long, tapering lobe (longer lobe can be bent) with thick, projecting acicula. Small digitiform ventral cirrus present. Abdominal notochaetae long capillaries. Abdominal neurochaetae long capillaries and forked chaetae with tines widely separated. Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. FI specimens are closest to Scoloplos (Leodamas) marginatus  Ehlers, 1897 in having a rather short thorax with 11 chaetiges (other know species from the area  S. (L.) tribulosus, S. (L.) cirratus  and S. (L.) ohlini have longer thorax with 27, 27 and 20-21 chatigers respectively). However Ehlers (1897) as well as Monro reported spines of thoracic region arranged consistently in 3 rows in S. (L.) marginatus, while these are arranged in 4 rows in FI specimen. Additionally, characters derived from abdominal parapodia are also different (see comparative Fig. 1). Falkland Islands specimens likely represent a new species, but more specimens, as well as more complete specimens will be necessary in order to formally describe this species.

Diagnosis. Vouchers three incomplete specimens, 6-9 mm long and 0.6-0.8 mm wide for 36-45 chaetigers; body cylindrical, narrowing posteriorly (Plate 1a). Colour in alcohol pale to dark yellow.
	Prostomium small, sharply conical (Plate 1b). Thorax with 9 chaetigers; notopodial and neuropodial postchaetal lobes very short, knob-like in chaetiger 1-2 (Plate 1e); notochaetal lobes on chaetigers 3 - 9 digitate (Plate 1e), become long and slender (Plate 1e); neuropodial lobes on chaetigers 3 – 9 mammiform (most pronounced on chaetigers 7 – 9) (Plate 1e); no subpodal or ventral papillae. All thoracic chaetae crenulated capillaries; in thoracic chaetigers few (10-20, size dependent), arranged in single row; numerous, arranged in 2 rows in neuropodia. Abdominal notochaetae included both crenulated capillaries and forked setae, with long weakly crenulated capillaries in abdominal neuropodia.
	All chaetae crenulated capillaries, few (10-20, size dependent) in notopodial, arranged in single row; arranged in 2 rows in neuropodia.
	Branchiae from chaetiger 17 or 18 (Plate 1f), initially small, inconspicuous, triangular, increasing slowly in size, becoming large, strap-like and changing shape to bluntly conical with the tip curved dorsally and to pointed distally assuming spear-head shape in posterior chaetigers (Plate 1d,g);  posterior branchiae up to twice length of notopodial lobes.
	Abdomen from chaetiger 10 (Plate 1e); abdominal notopodial postchaetal lobes resemble those of thorax but thinner and longer; abdominal neuropodial lobes robust,cylindrical, distally bilobed, both lobes short and blunt with outer lobe narrower (Plate 1 c,d); subpodal flange moderately developed in anterior abdominal chaetigers becoming extremely high and narrow in posterior abdominal chaetigers (Plate 1c), subpodal papillae and interramal cirri lacking. Pygidium not observed.
	Remarks. Currently, five Southern Ocean species (L. kerguelensis, L. kerguelensis minutus, L. mawsoni,  L. geminus and L. banzareae) and one South American species (L. chilensis) in the genus Leitoscoloplos are known thanks to revisionary work of Mackie (1987). Particularly the Southern Ocean species tended to be “lumped” under L. kerguelensis as careful examination of abdomen (which is often mostly incomplete) is necessary to distinguish between different species. Of the species recorded from the region, Leitoscoloplos sp. 1  is most similar to L. kerguelensis in possessing nine thoracic segments, but it can be easily distinguished by much later start of branchiae from chaetigers 17-18 as opposed to 13-15 in L. kerguelensis, as well as by a combination of other characters (see the table below). Falkland Island specimens represent a new species requiring formal description.

Syllinae sp. 1
Voucher specimen.  SEA LION: station 19MFA.
Diagnosis. Voucher is a single specimen collected, complete, large and robust specimen in good condition; 45mm long and 3.5mm wide (including parapodia) for about 300 chaetigers; all segments very short (crowded); body in alcohol dark yellow with distinct reddish-brown pigmentation dorsally on about 50 chaetigers (most pronounced on first 30 chaetigers), dorsally cirri also heavily pigmented.
Prostomium pentagonal bearing three antennae and two palps. Palps short (about the same length as prostomium), relatively narrow triangular lobes, basally free from each other. Antennae long, distinctly articulated, positioned anteriorly to eyes; lateral antennae slightly shorter than median antenna. Eyes present, 2 pairs of large purple eyes in trapezoid arrangement (anterior and posterior pairs located very close to each other). Pharynx not everted. First segment achaetous laterally with a pair of long, distinctly articulated tentacular cirri (similar to antenna).
Parapodia uniramous, conical; with long, distinctly articulated dorsal cirri of the two types, often alternating –  longer (with around 40 articulations) heavily pigmented and shorter ones, without pigmentation; ventral cirri only weakly articulated, slightly shorter than the tip of parapodia, inserted basally. In mid-body chaetigers parapodia with 3 aciculae not protruding through integument, all with blunt rounded tip. Chaetae all compound falcigers, about 6 per fascicle; all with short, curved, distally unidentae blades, with serrated margins. Pygidium rounded lobe with 2 quite short (extending over the last 10 very crowded segments) articulated lateral anal cirri.
Remarks. Although FI specimen is in a good condition, assigning it to a named species is difficult due to taxonomic complexities in the absence of observation of proboscis. We are referring this species to subfamily-level morphospecies Syllinae sp. 1.

"Sphaerosyllis perspicax Ehlers, 1908"," Sphaerosyllis perspicax Ehlers, 1908
Voucher.  SEA LION: station 19MFC
Diagnosis. Voucher is a complete specimen; very small, slender species; 3mm long and 0.35mm wide for 28 chaetigers, pygidium damaged. Integument papillated; colour in alcohol pale yellow. Prostomium about twice as wide as long bearing three antennae and two palps. Palps fused along their length, short. Antennae smooth, arising nearly at same level, bottle-shaped, of equal size. Two pairs of large red eyes present, arranged in almost straight line, inner pair large, posterior pair smaller; pair of small red eyespots present, positioned anteriorly on prostomium. Pharyngeal tooth located near anterior margin. Proventricle short, extending through chaetigers 2-4.
First segment achaetous laterally with a pair of smooth, short, bottle-shaped tentacular cirri. Parapodia uniramous, short but distinct, conical. Dorsal cirri on chaetiger 2 absent, in other chaetigers bottle-shaped (similar to antennae and dorsal cirri) in anterior chaetigers, becoming progressively elongated and narrow in posterior chaetigers.
Chaetae observed were falcigers with slender, slightly curved, unidentate blades; chaetae often broken off, simple chaetae likely broken off. Acicula clearly observed in posterior chaetigers, where solitary, acuminate. Pygidium damaged.
Remarks. Falkland Islands specimens agree well with Sphaerosyllis perspicax Ehlers, 1908 described from South Georgia, which probably belongs to Erinaceusyllis according to San Martin (2005). Specimens agree in that anterior dorsal cirri are strongly inflated at their bases and absent form chaetiger 2, the eyes and the antennae are both arranged in line, the palps are completely fused all along their length. Females brooding eggs dorsally, by means of capillary notochaetae were observed in material from Falkland Islands.

Sphaerodorum olgae Moreira & Parapar, 2011
Voucher specimen. SEA LION: stations 13MFA, 18MFA and 28MFC.
Diagnosis.  Small-sized species; the largest voucher (13MFA) is a complete specimen with elongated, distally tapering body; voucher specimen 3.5mm long, 0.5 mm wide, for about 40 chaetigers. Body elongated, tapering; body surface papillated; yellowish in ethanol. Prostomium bluntly rounded, fused to peristomium; with median antenna and three pairs of lateral prostomial appendages; all very short, digitiform.
Two macrotubercles per chaetiger; each dorsal to parapodia; spherical to pear-shaped, provided with terminal papilla. From chaetiger 2 posteriorly two microtubercles per chaetiger, dorsal to macrotubercles, with a basal collar and a long terminal papilla. Papillae on all body surfaces. About four irregular rows of about 10 small papillae per each row covering dorsum, relatively densely distributed, additionally about 2 papillae per row between macro- and micro tubercle; in venter about 10 small papillae in about 2-3 irregular rows.
Parapodia uniramous; conical. Parapodia of first chaetiger in ventral position; following parapodia lateral. Parapodia with about 10 digiform papillae on all surfaces. Strongly curved hooks in first chaetiger (one per parapodium), visible in ventral view. Chaetae about 4 per fascicle, many broken off, and those remaining clearly simple, appearing somewhat spear-shaped with small subdistal boss, distal end falciform, pointed.
Remarks. The specimens are consistent with genus Sphaerodorum Örsted, 1843 as it possesses 2 rows of macortubercles, large hook on chaetiger 1 and simple chaetae, unlike similar genus Ephesiella Chamberlin,1919 which has compound chaetae. This genus is represented in the region by two species Sphaerodorum indutum  Fauchald, 1974 known from Scotia Sea to Peter I Island and S. olgae Moreira & Parapar, 2011 from Bellingshausen Sea. Falkland Islands specimens correspond well to S. olgae in the form of recurved hooks on chaetiger 1, form and number of simple chaetae and pattern of papillation on dorsum and parapodia. Full description of S. olgae and comparison with other known species is given by Moreira & Parapar, 2011.

Sphaerodoropsis sp. 4
Voucher specimen. SEA LION: stations 3MFB and 6MFC.
Diagnosis.  Small sized species; voucher specimen short and maggot-like, tapering anteriorly and posteriorly; 4.5mm long, 0.8mm wide for about 22 chaetigers. Six sessile and distally rounded, globular macrotubercles in each of the two transverse rows per chaetiger; macrotubercles in a zig-zag pattern on dorsum, not tightly packed (dorsum easily visible); the lateralmost macrotubercles often smaller than others; surface of all macrotubercles evenly covered by many small papillae. Dorsum covered by one to very few small papillae located in spaces between macrotubercles. Uniramous parapodia short, cylindrical with one small papilla observed on parapodium (dorsal side); ventral cirri short, digiform; chaetae compound, unidentate falcigers, about 8 per fascicle. Venter sparsely covered with small papillae forming 2 regular rows, each with 4-5 papillae in each row.
Remarks. Falkland Islands specimens belong to group of Spaherodoropsis with more than 4 rows of macrotubercles (Borowski, 1994). Several species with similar number and arrangement of macrotubercle are known, including those known from the region. Important characters that differentiate between species, related to number and patterns formed by papillae on ventrum and parapodia (see Moreira et al., 2004 for details). This species is very similar to Sphaerodoropsis sp. 1 also recorded from Falkland Islands in its number and arrangement of macrotubercles, but the presence of multiple papillae on surface of macrotubercles differentiates Sphaerodoropsis sp. 4. This feature is not commonly reported in Sphaerodoridae. For now, we assign this specimen to morphospecies Sphaerodoropsis sp. 4.

Pseudoscalibregma bransfieldium (Hartman, 1967)
Voucher specimen. SEA LION: station 10MFB and 22MFA.
Diagnosis.  A medium-sized species, body elongate, arenicoliform, expanded in anterior half then tapering to narrow abdominal region; both voucher specimens incomplete, the larger voucher 14mm long and 2.8mm wide at its widest for 25 chaetigers. Colour in alcohol light yellow. Body segments biannulate; chaetiger 1-3 not reticulated, in subsequent segments reticulationlation formed of squared cells; body surface rugose, the annulation pronounced. Pygidium missing.
Prostomium with well-developed narrow, elongated processes or horns, pointed anterolaterally; posterior margin of prostomium visible dorsally; with distinct nuchal crest on posterior half of prostomium; eyes absent. Branchiae absent.
Parapodia biramous, inconspicuous in anterior chaetigers, becoming large and well developed in middle and posterior chaetigers. Dorsal and ventral cirri present in mid and posterior chaetigers; large and inflated. All chaetigers with noto- and neuropodial fascicles of slender capillaries; in anterior region arranged into in about 5 rows, with chaetae of posterior row longest. Lyrate chaetae with unequal tynes. Pygidium unknown.
Remarks.  The presence of nuchal crest on posterior part of prostomium as well as arrangement and type chaetae and form of dorsal and ventral cirri agree well with Pseudoscalibregma bransfieldium (Hartman, 1967). The reticulation has not been described by Hartman (1967) or in re-description by Blake (1981), but images provided by both authors suggest that the anteriormost segments lack distinct reticulation although these are distinctly bi-annulated as in Falkland Islands’ specimens. For comparison with other Pseudoscalibregma species collected form Falkland Islands, see entry under Pseudoscalibregma sp. 1.
Distribution: Antarctic Penisnsula, Bransfield Strait, Weddell Sea, Ross Sea and Falkland Islands. Depth distribution 335 – 916m. In Falkland Islands recorded from depths of around 500m.

"Prosphaerosyllis sp. 1"," Genus Prosphaerosyllis San Martín, 1984
Prosphaerosyllis sp. 1
Voucher. SEA LION: station 28MFB.
Diagnosis. Voucher is a complete specimen; very small, slender species;  3.5 mm long and 0.4mm wide for 30 chaetigers. Integument of body smooth, but palps papillated; colour in alcohol yellow. Prostomium short, only slightly wider than long. Antennae not observed (assumed missing). Palps very short and compact, fused along their length, provided with small papillae. Two pairs of relatively large red eyes present, in trapezoid arrangement, with anterior and posterior pair very closely together (almost appearing as a single eye), posterior pair circular, anterior pair cup-shaped; presence of additional eyespost not confirmed. Proventricle extending through chaetigers 4-6.  First segment achaetous tentacular cirri not observed (assumed missing). Parapodia uniramous, short but distinct, conical. Dorsal cirri likely present in all chaetigers (missing on several anterior segments, but observed on chaetigers 2 and 3), where present bottle-shaped throughout the body becoming only slightly more elongated in posterior chaetigers. Chaetae often missing (broken off), one simple chaeta usually observed, the rest of chaetae compound falcigers. Acicula clearly observed in posterior chaetigers where solitary, acuminate. Pygidium damaged.
Remarks. Falkland Islands specimens have integument of body smooth (uncharacteristically for the genus), but small palps appear to be heavily papillated. Prosphaerosyllis palpopapillata (Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1992) described from Antarctic Peninsula (63º16.40'S, 63º42.78'W), from 300m depth and intertidal Brazilian species Prosphaerosyllis isabellae (Nogueira, San Martín & Amaral, 2001) are the only known species  exhibiting such characters. However palps appear to be much reduced in Falkland Island specimens and form of antennae and dorsal cirri cannot be confirmed. Therefore we refer this specimen to morphospecies Prosphaerosyllis sp. 1 until further assement becomes possible.

Diagnosis.  Small to medium sized species with well-developed cephalic and anal plaques, vouchers all complete specimens with 19 chaetigers and 6 pre-anal rings; all chaetigers of similar lengths, relatively short (only slightly longer than wide); anal rings 1-3 shorter, but not crowded, anal rings 4-6, crowded (could be overlook as a single ring). Colour in alcohol tan. Voucher 35 MFC 1.8mm long and 0.6mm wide.
Prostomium with well-developed cephalic plaque; high rim with one ventral, two ventro-lateral and two dorsolateral notches, palpode not developed; cephalic keel developed along the entire length of cephalic plaque; nuchal organs straight, bordering cephalic peak throughout its length.
First chaetiger with both noto- and neurochaetae. Neurochaete (uncini) reduced in number in chaetigers 1- 3, where uncini as stout, curved spines (occasionally much reduced dentition can be detected distally),  1-2 per fascicle; straw to light brown in colour. Rostrate hooks fully developed from 4th neuropodium, with barbells, around 10 per ramus in mid segments.
Anal plaque symmetrical, border by 28 anal cirri, moderately long, cirriform, of equal length with the exception of midventral cirrus (often missing), which is longer  (twice the length of other cirri). Conical anus protruding from anal plaque.
Remarks.  This species has been ascribed to genus Praxillella based on the combination of the following characters: well developed cephalic and anal plaques, symmetrical anal plaque border by cirri of (mostly) equal size, neurochaetae of chaetigers 1-3 as spines and anus protruding from anal plaque.  Revision of Maldanidae form the region is needed and currently we ascribe Falkland Islands’ specimens to Praxillella sp. 1.

Diagnosis.  Voucher is a complete specimen with 35 segments (divided into two fragments). Prostomium bilobed, with cephalic peaks; ceratophore of median antenna in anterior notch, style of median antenna papillate, slightly inflated subdistally, then abruptly tapering; lateral antennae inserted ventrally with styles papillate, tapering. Anterior pair of eyes situated dorsolaterally on widest part of prostomium, posterior pair dorsally near hindmargin of prostomium. Palps papillate, tapering.
Tentaculophores inserted laterally to prostomium, each with notochaetae and a dorsal and ventral tentacular cirrus with styles of cirri slightly inflated subdistally, then abruptly tapering, the dorsal cirri longer than ventral cirri. Second segment with first pair of elytra, biramous parapodia, and long buccal cirri.
Fifteen pairs of elytra, all eytra present. Outer lateral margin and adjacent surface of elytra with dense fringe of long, filiform papillae; elytral surface covered with conical microtubercles, posterior half of elytra with numerous conical macrotubercles; macrotubercules distally mulifid.
Cirrigerous segments with dorsal cirri with cylindrical cirrophore, style papillate, tapering. Ventral cirri with smooth, tapering style. Parapodia biramous; notopodia with elongate acicular lobe; neuropodia larger than notopodia; tips of noto- and neuroacicula penetrating epidermis. Notochaetae stouter than neurochaetae; notochaetae with distinct rows of spines and blunt tip. Neurochaetae uni – and bidentate; unidentate falcate, with rows of spines distally; bidentate with slender secondary tooth (often abraded). Pygidium with a pair of very long (reaching back over 10 segments), thin, papillate anal cirri.
Remarks.  Falkland Islands specimen cannot be assigned to any known Harmothoe species review recently form the Southern and Atlantic Oceans (Barnich et al. 2006; Barnich and Fiege, 2010) and likely represent a new species. Of the Harmothoe species known from the region, Falkland Islands specimen is most similar to Harmothoe fuligineum (Baird, 1865) in having elytra with have fringe of long papillae on outer margin. However, the macortubercules in the known species are distally entire, rounded, while in Falkland Islands specimens these are multifid.

Voucher. SEA LION: station 46MFA, 64MFB and 57MFA.
Diagnosis. Voucher incomplete; small to medium sized species; the largest voucher with body 9mm long for 38 chaetigers. Mid- body segments distinctly triannulate. Long and slender conical prostomium consisting of indistinct rings; terminal ring with four appendages. Proboscis with two types of papillae, both with subapical tufts of cilia: 1. numerous long, slender digitiform papillae, lacking pigmentation, without obvious ridges (using light microscopy); 2. less numerous, isolated shorter and broader, digitiform papillae, lacking pigmentation. Terminal part of proboscis with four hook-shaped jaws arranged in a cross and accessory ailerons with triangular base (sensu Böggemann, 2002).
First two pairs of parapodia uniramous, following parapodia biramous. Two triangular to digitiform prechaetal lobes and one shorter, broad, distally rounded, somewhat truncated postchaetal lobe. Dorsal cirri oval to globular, positioned on body wall far above parapodial base. Ventral cirri short digitiform. Branchiae not observed.  Noto- and neuropodia each with a single acicula. Notochaetae slender, straight or weakly recurved capillary with serration one side. Neurochaetae compound spinigers with blades of different lengths, with serration one side. Pygidium uknown.
Remarks. Off Glycera species reviewed and described by Böggemann (2002, 2009) species with triangular aileron bases, tend to possess longer and slender digitiform  proboscidial papillae as well as shorter broad, ovoid papillae. However in Falkland Island specimens, both type of papillae are rather slender and conical, with the numerous type particularly long and slender as otherwise seen in Glycera tesselata.  However bases of ailerons of G. tesselata are deeply incised, not triangular. Species of Glycera commonly reported from the region - Glycera kerguelensis McIntosh, 1885 (considered synonym of Glycera capitata by Böggemann (2002)) has shown cryptic diversity in molecular analysis (Schüller, 2011; Brasier et al., 2016). Glyceridae reported from the region are clearly in need of a revision and we currently assign Falkland Islands’ specimens to morphospecies Glycera sp. 2.

Voucher specimens. SEA LION: station 6MFB, 9MFB and 51MFB.
Diagnosis. Few large and robust and several small and slender specimens were collected, which are here considered as adult and juvenile examples of the same species; all in tough (hard to open) tubes composed of particles and internally lined with membrane. Voucher is a relatively large, robust specimen 17mm long, about 0.8mm wide, posteriorly incomplete. Prostomium collar-like, short (similar in length to chaetiger 1); no eyes. Thorax composed of 3 uniramous chaetigers of varying length: 1st short, 2nd longer (1.5 – 2x the length of 1st chaetiger), 3rd short again. Abdominal segments very long (till end of body, which is an incomplete fragment). Notochaetae long, coarsely serrated capillaries; neuropodial hooks from chaetiger 4, arranged in many (about 20) alternating rows in anterior abdomen and in about 13 irregular rows in posterior abdomen. Form of uncini similar in anterior and posterior abdomen, all bidentate, with equally sized, slender, widely separated teeth arranged dorsally and ventrally; manubrium straight (slightly larger just below the teeth, but not forming subdistal knob). Pygidium uknown.
Remarks. Galathowenia scotiae (Hartman, 1978) – described with prostomium missing  by Hartman (1978) who reported there are only 2 instead of 3 thoracic (uniramous) chaetigers. Based on Hartman’s drawing the chaetiger 2 (which she considered chaetiger 1) is about the same length as the following chaetiger, however in key provided by De León-González & Sanchez-Hernández, 2012 and in Capa et al. 2012 G. scotiae is cited as having 2nd thoracic segment twice the length of the 1st and 3rd, which corresponds well with FI specimen. However G. scotiae differs from Falkland Islands’ specimens in that the manubrium of uncini has an abvious enlarged subdistal knob and two unicnal teeth appear to be close together. Importantly, there is a “groove” present between 1st and 2nd chaetigers in G. scotiae and this feature was not unambiguously confirmed in Falkland Islands’ specimens. Parapar (2003) suggested: “There is a need for a revision of the genus Galathowenia, and particularly of the sibling species characterized by the absence of eyes, the presence of a thoracic slit between the first and second setigers, and a similar head and hook shape”. The most similar species outside the geographical area is G. piltzi described by Blake (2000) from 92m, off California, which possesses similar types of hooks and sparse serration on notochaetae as seen in Falkland Islands specimens, but the 3 thoracic segments are all of the same length. With current evidence we assign Falkland Islands specimens to Galathowenia sp. 1.
Other Galtahowenia species known from the region, differ in following (main) characters:
G. longicollaris (Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1989) – with 3 thoracic chaetigers, its prostomium is much (about 4x) longer than the first segment.
G. joinvillensis (Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1989) – with only 2 thoracic chaetigers.
G. antarctica Cantone & Di Pietro 2001 – with 2 short thoracic chaetigers.

Diagnosis. Body short, flattened, oval and coiled up;  2.2mm long and 1.8mm wide for 13 chaetigers.  Prostomium with 5 antennae, four paired antennae on anterior of prostomium, short and digitform, median antenna slightly larger than others, in two sections, with short stout basal section and a longer slender terminal. Caruncle extending to chaetiger 4. A pair of relatively large eyes present, situated between chaetigers 1 and 2.
Parapodia biramous with dorsal, lateral and ventral cirri. Branchiae present from chaetiger 1, cirriform, one per segment throughout arising just behind and laterally to dorsal cirri; dorsally cirri longer and more slender than accompanying branchiae. Other parapodial appeandaes include lateral cirrus and ventral cirrus.  Chaetae very well developed, long and numerous; notochaetae of one type, forked with smooth long prongs; neurochaetae all bifurcate with coarsely serrated long prongs; ringent chaetae absent.
Remarks.  This small species is consistent with Euphrosinopsis crassiseta Kudenov (1993) in having single cirriform branchia arising just behind and laterally to dorsal cirri and lacking ringent chaetae.   
However previous records of this species are from much greater depth - 3697m in Weddell Sea rather than ~1000m as in Falkland Islands specimens, which we refer to  Euphrosinopsis cf. crassiseta. Kudenov (1993) provided a full description of this species as well as descriptions of other euhprosinid and amphinomid species known from the area and we recommend this publication for further details. Other species collected from Falkland Islands – E. antipoda, can be distinguished by presence of ringent notochaetae.

Voucher specimen. LOLIGO: station 1MFA; INFLEXIBLE:  station 2MFB and 5MFA.
Diagnosis. Even the largest voucher (LOLIGO 1MFA) is a small, fragile, but complete specimen with 38 chaetigers, 7mm long and 0.8mm wide (including parapodia).
Prostomium with 5 articulated antenna, with the median antenna longest, the shortest ventralmost pair bi-articulated; with a pair of very small red eyes located postero-laterally on prostomium. Peristomium broad, with a pair of short tentacular cirri. Branchiae present from chaetiger 3 to chaetiger 16 branched (with single filaments from chaetiger 3 to chaetiger 8; maximally with 2 filaments), distinctly longer than notopodial cirri in anterior and middle branchial chaetigers, with single short filament in posterior most branchial chaetigers. Ring-shaped bases in posterior notopodia not confirmed. Chaetae including smooth limbate chaetae and compound bidentate falcigers present in all chaetigers, additionally bidentate subacicular hooks, appearing singly from chaetiger 11; pectinate chaetae not clearly observed. Pygidium with two long lateral and one very short dorsomedial anal cirri, all slender, without articulations. Maxillary formula not examined (specimen small and fragile).
Remarks.  Small size and underdeveloped branchiae suggest these specimens may be juveniles (see also Orensanz, 1990). Eunice pennata  is a cosmopolitan species with wide distribution, including previous report from the region (see Orensanz, 1990 and more recently Quiroga and Levin, 2010 for detailed discussion). Fauchald (1992) mentioned that besides branchiae starting on chaetiger 3, the unique feature of the species is the presence of ring-shaped bases in posterior notopodia  (see also Quiroga and Levin, 2010), which was not confirmed in Falkland Islands specimens, likely due to their small size. Given that type locality of Eunice pennata  is Norway (Oslofjord), we prefer to assign Falkland Islands’ specimens to  Eunice cf. penata until molecular evidence becomes available.

Remarks.  The well-developed parapodia of the anterior end affiliated this specimen with Drilonereis sp. reported by Orensanz (1990). This character also distinguishes the specimen from D. tenuis, in which the parapodia of anterior end are very small and which was also found to be present in Falkland Islands (see entry Drilonereis tenuis). Other species known from the wider region (off Chile) include D. chilensis Hartmann-Schröder, 1965 and D. viborita Orensanz, 1990. Orensanz (1990) suggested that several undescribed species may be present in the region, with Drilonereis sp. 1 likely representing one of them.

"Cossura sp. 1"," Note: Here we follow recommendation of Zhadan (2015) for cossurid taxonomy, that the most important characteristic is the number of thoracic segments. Thoracic segments are short, usually flattened dorsoventrally and chaetae emerge from the anterior border of the segments; abdominal segments are longer, often bead-like, and chaetae emerge from the middle of them.
Cossura Webster & Benedict, 1887
Cossura sp. 1
Voucher specimen. SEA LION: station 56MFB.
Diagnosis. Small, slender species, all specimens fragmented. Voucher specimen incomplete composed of anterior fragment with about 20 thoracic chaetigers and about 5 damaged abdominal chaetigers (the only example long enough to show transition between thorax and abdomen), about 2.5 mm long and 0.25mm wide. Abdomen and pygidium unknown; few damaged abdominal segments observed, these appear to be inflated, bead-like. Colour in alcohol pale yellow. Prostomium longer than wide, anteriorly bluntly rounded (appear almost slightly truncated). Branchial filament inserted posteriorly on chaetiger 2 (near the border of chaetiger 2and 3). Chaetiger 1 with uniramous parapodia, all the next segments with biramous parapodia. All chaetae hirsute capillaries with smooth shafts; arranged in two rows. Thickened chaetae present in about 20 (=thoracic) segments, tapering into long, thin tip.  Few abdominal segments observed lacking thickened chaetae.
Remarks. Even though this species was very abundant (~400 specimens collected) not a single complete specimen was encountered. Specimens appear to be fragmented at transition between thorax and abdomen, with mid and posterior part of the body (=abdomen), which are diagnostic, not observed. However only few known species possess thickened chaetae in thoracic chaetigers as is the case in Falkland Islands’ specimens. This feature was also described for Cossura heterochaeta (type locality: Argentina), C. rostrata,  C. ginesi and C. hutchingsae. Cossura ginesi differs by the shape of prostomium with anterior extension. C. hutchingsae has inflated pads in thorax and the segmental borders drawn forward dorsally. Cossura heterochaeta and C. rostrata have a conical prostomium, which is rounded in Falkland Islands specimen. Further, there are two types of anterior thickened chaetae—with arista and without it—in C. heterochaeta and Falkland Islands’ specimens have more thoracic segments – about 20, instead of 12–14 in C. heterochaeta. Summary of Cossura species known from the area can be found in table below. Until better preserved specimens become available, we assign Falkland Island specimens to morphospecies Cossura sp. 1.

"Clymenura sp. 3"," Clymenura sp. 3
Voucher specimen. SEA LION: station 11MFB.
Diagnosis. Voucher is a small sized, incomplete specimen; 14mm long and 0.6mm wide for 11 chaetigers long fragment; preserved specimen light pink in colour. Chaetigers 1-9 relatively short (but longer than wide) and distinctly separated by deep intersegmental grooves; chaetigers 10 and 11 elongated, rest of the fragment too damaged. Chaetiger 8 with a distinct semi-circular glandular pad on dorsum as typical for this genus, pad is almost short (less than half of the chaetiger 8).               
Prostomium with cephalic plaque; cephalic rim extremely low; without any notches or dips near mid-anterior peak, palpode not developed. Nuchal organs straight, slightly diverging anteriorly, extending throughout 3/4 of length of cephalic plaque, bordering a very low lying cephalic keel, which extends throughout the length of the cephalic plaque.
Notochaetae capillaries of two types – long, smooth, very narrowly limbate chaetae and shorter, very thin capillaries. In chaetigers 1 -3 single stout, amber colour spine observed; from chaetiger 4  rostrate uncini arranged in single row, up to 30 per ramus in mid segments, with  manubrial constriction on its shaft, barbells not observed. Posterior end and pygidium not observed. Tube not observed.
Remarks.  Although specimen is incomplete, the characteristic pad on chaetiger 8 was observed. Even in the absence of posterior end, this species of Clymenura can be distinguished from other three morphospecies recorded in this study from Falkland Islands by its extremely low rim of cephalic plaque. Currently this specimen is assigned to morphospecies Clymenura sp. 3.

Ceratocephale sp. 1

Voucher. SEA LION: station 38MFA.

Diagnosis.  Voucher specimen posteriorly incomplete 7.0 mm long and 1.5 mm wide (including parapodia), for 25 chaetigers (damaged). Alcohol preserved material  pale yellow with golden setae and black aciculae. Prostomium rectangular (slightly wider than long), with pair of long, thin, triangular antennae lying closely against palps. Palps tapering, about the same length as antennae, with large palpophores. Eyes absent. Two pairs of tentacular cirri of similar length, all rather short. Pharynx inverted (not observed).
Parapodia bi-ramous, with notopodia slightly shorter than neuropodia. Dorsal cirrus slender tapering, only slightly longer than notopodial ligule, their cirrophores appear expanded on most chaetigers. Notopodia with elongate  prechaetal ligule and short, blunt postchaetal lobe. Neuropodia (mid body) with bluntly rounded postchaetal lobe and elongate digitiform precheatal ligule. Ventral neuropodial ligule digitiform, elongated. Ventral cirri not branched on chaetigers 1-2, from chaetiger 3 bifid till end of the fragment, ventralmost cirrus tiny on chaetiger 3 (easily overlooked), about ½ the length of primary cirrus in chaetigers 4-5, only slightly subequal in length to primary cirri on subsequent segments.Notopodial chaetae arranged in 2 bundles on either side of prechaetal ligule. Neuropodial chaetae similarly arranged. Chaetae consist entirely of homogomph spinigers with finely serrated blades; chaetae straw coloured. Narrow transverse dorsal ridges connecting the notopodia present from chaetiger 5 till end of the fragment. The rest of the body and pygidium uknown.
Remarks. Genus Ceratocephale is characterised by bifid ventral cirri (this characters is also shared with genus Gymnonereis, which additionally also has bifid dorsal cirri). The appearance of the double ventral cirrus together with characters such as – presence or absence of eyes, appearance of expanded dorsal cirriophores, presence of dorsal ridges, form of chaetae and characters derived from proboscis. The differences appear to be rather subtle (see Table 1. for comparison). Falkland Island specimens agree most with C. hartmanae having bifid ventral cirri from chaetiger 3 and all chaetae homogomph spinigers, but this species is unique in having mid-dorsal flaps in median body region. While the presence of such flaps cannot be assessed in Falkland Islands material (all specimens very short) two species differ in chaetiger in which dorsal ridges start. Currently we prefer to assign Falkland Island specimens to morphospecies Ceratocephale sp. 2.

"Brada sp. 1"," Brada Stimpson, 1854

Brada sp. 1

Voucher specimens. SEA LION: station 35MFB, 18MFA and 29MFB.

Diagnosis.  Medium to large sized species. The largest voucher complete specimen with 35 chaetigers , 45mm long and 7mm wide at  widest point. Body fusiform, tapering posteriorly. Body greyish, incrusted with particles particularly dorsally giving it rusty appearance. Body densely and irregularly covered with small papillae; papillae incrusted on dorsum (not visible), on ventrum papillae more exposed, appearing short and cirriform. First chaetiger with prolonged capillary chaetae, about 12 chaetae on each side.  In subsequent segments notochaetae few, about 2 per fascicle, long, thin capillaries. Neurochaetae acicular, straight, amber-coloured, about 5 per fascicle.  Large rounded nephridial papillae present ventrally to neuropodia of chaetiger 5.

Remarks.  Several species of Brada have been recorded from the region with Brada mamillata Grube, 1877 described from Kerguelen Is. and later reported by Hartman (1953) from Falkland Islands in 7-8m water depth.  Most species were poorly described or assumed to belong to species with type locality in Northern Europe. Revision of species of Brada from the region is needed. Currently we ascribe the specimens from Falkland Islands to morphospecies Brada sp. 1.

Pectinariidae sp. 1
Voucher. ENDEVOUR: station E4FB.
Diagnosis. Small sized specimen, body conical in shape, voucher complete, 4mm long (including the palelae) and about 0.4mm wide; not in the best condition slightly desiccated.  
Rim of cephalic veil appears smooth or at the best with very shallow indistinct dense cerration. Cephalic veil completely free from operculum, forming a slender triangular lobe around the peristomial palps. Raised opercular margin well developed, smooth. Operculum with 9 pairs of long amber-coloured paleae, with blunt tips. Two pair of slender, elongated tentacular cirri and two pairs of branchiae on segments 3 and 4 present (specimen too dessicated to clearly observed these clearly).
Chaetigers 1 to 3 (segments 5 to 7) with notopodia and notochaetae only. Chaetigers 4 to 17 biramous with both notopodia, neuropodia, and notochaetae and uncini.  Notochaetae from chaetiger 4 include smooth winged capillaries, and capillaries with finely serrated margins. Notochaetae from chaetiger 14 with finely hirsute surfaces. Uncini  forming “paw-like” pattern with irregular rows of small teeth above the main. Posterior scaphe and abdomen distinctly separated. Posterior 5 segments fused to form scaphe. Scaphe slightly longer than broad, with narrow elongated dorsal papilla. Scaphal hooks present, 6 pairs, stout, distally blunt.
Remarks.  Hutchings and Peart (2002) provided a review of genera of Pectinariidae, with 5 valid genera.  The combination of the characters observed in Falkland Island specimens (see Table 1. below) differs from the know genera, suggesting it may represents a new genus (or need to amend generic definition). It is affiliated most closely with genus Petta Malmgren, 1866 in having smooth cephalic veil, smooth dorsal opercular rim and 14 pairs of neuropodia, however its scaphe is distinctly separated from the abdomen. Further, teeth of uncini are not neatly arranged in 1 (or 2 as common in some genera) row, but instead from “paw-like” pattern with irregular rows of small teeth above the main fang as known in Ampharetidae (SEM is needed to fully establish the form of uncini).  Ideally, a greater number of well-preserved specimens need to be examined in order to diagnose this genus, as it is not clear if some variation observed here is an artefact of desiccation of the voucher specimen. At present, we suggest to assign this specimen to morphospecies Pectinariidae sp. 1.

Voucher. VINSON WEST: station 5MFB.
Diagnosis.  Voucher specimen complete; 4mm long and  1.2 mm wide (including parapodia) for 33 chaetigers. Body dorso-ventrally flattened; preserved specimens pale yellow without pigmentation. Pharynx inverted in all specimens but visible through body wall. Prostomium about three times wider than long; rounded anteriorly; with a pair of anterior antennae and a median antenna located on middle of prostomium, all antennae similar in length and shape, short, globular to digiform. A pair of palps present ventrally on anterior margin of prostomium, slender and slightly longer than antennae. Segment 1 achaetous with a single pair of short, ovoid to digiform tentacular cirri. Chaetigers 1–3 uniramous. Notopodia and neuropodia similar in shape and size, both long and cylindrical with well developed lobes; dorsal and ventral cirri not observed. Notochaetae present from chaetiger 4; about 20 long capillaries with serrated edge, serration widely spaced. Neurochaetae about 30 composite spinigers (4 of those much shorter than others), with long unidentate blades with finely serrated edge. The last three chaetigers very reduced. Pygidium rounded lobe, no cirri observed (missing?).
Remarks. Genus Lacydonia contains 10 valid species (see comparative table in Magalhães et al. 2012), broadly divided into occulate and annoculate groups. Three species are known from the area: L. mikrops Ehlers, 1913; L. oculata Hartman, 1967 (=synonym of L. antarctica) and L. gorda Hartmann-Schröder, 1993. Of these only the last species lacks eyes and is therefore most similar to Falkland Island specimen. Falkland Island specimen appear to differ from  L. gordia in development of notopodia (these are long in FI specimen not truncated). However as Magalhães et al. (2012) noted that most known species of Lacydonia are known only through a single or few type specimens and ontogenetic variation is unknown.  Hartmann-Schröder’s (1993) description is also rather brief. Without molecular data it is difficult to currently establish if these constitute the same species. Given the morphological differences observed here, we assign Falkland Island specimens to morphospecies Lacydonia sp. 1 until more evidence becomes available.

Voucher. LOLIGO: station L11FB.
Diagnosis.  Voucher specimen posteriorly incomplete 4.0 mm long and 1.0 mm wide (including parapodia), for 22 chaetigers. Alcohol preserved material, pale yellow in colour with golden setae and black aciculae. Prostomium rectangular, with pair of long, thin, triangular antennae lying closely against palps. Palps tapering, about the same length as antennae, with large palpophores. Eyes absent.  Two pairs of tentacular cirri with the longest extending to the beginning of chaetiger 3.  Pharynx inverted (not observed).
Parapodia bi-ramous, with notopodia slightly shorter than neuropodia. Dorsal cirrus slender tapering, longer than other parapodia appendages, their cirrophores expand, becoming fully expanded from around chaetiger 10. Notopodia with elongate prechaetal ligule and short, blunt postsetal lobe. Neuropodia (mid body) with bluntly rounded postchaetal lobe and elongate digitiform precheatal ligule. Ventral neuropodial ligule conical (subequal in length to primary ventral cirrus). Ventral cirri bifid throughout (present from chaetiger 1 till end of the fragment), with ventralmost cirri about half the length of primary cirri.
Notopodial chaetae arranged in 2 bundles on either side of prechaetal ligule. Neuropodial chaetae similarly arranged. Chaetae consist of mostly homogomph and few sesquigomph spinigers with finely serrated blades. Chaetae far more numerous on chaetigers 3-9 than on subsequent chaetigers; chaetae straw coloured.  Narrow transverse dorsal ridges connecting the notopodia present from chaetigers 14 till end of the fragment. The rest of the body and pygidium uknown.
Remarks. Genus Ceratocephale is characteristic by bifid ventral cirri (this character is also shared with genus Gymnonereis, which additionally also has bifid dorsal cirri). The appearance of the double ventral cirrus together with characters such as – presence or absence of eyes, appearance of expanded dorsal cirriophores, presence of dorsal ridges, form of chaetae and characters derived from proboscis. The differences appear to be rather subtle (see Table 1. for comparison).  Currently we prefer to assign Falkland Island specimens to morphoscpecies Ceratocephale sp. 1, as differences from known species were observed as are summarised in Table 1. below.

Proboscis partially everted; paragnaths present (their distribution not determined), dark jaws present.  For form of parapodia and chaetae see attached plates. Pygidium uknown.
Remarks. Both voucher specimens are very small and we cannot exclude that they are juveniles. The patterns of paragnaths was not determined as proboscis was only partially extended. Type specimen of Neanthes typhla (Monro, 1930) described from South Georgia is present in NHM collection and was checked. The following differences were noted, but given that Monro’s specimen was much larger, it is not clear if observed difference can be contributed to size differences:
- the posterior most dorsal cirrus is longer than the others in Falklands Is. specimen, but of similar size or only slightly longer in N. typhla
- lobes of parapodia are protruding into sharp tips in Falkland Is. specimens, but are more oblique/rounded  in N. typhla

Flabelligena sp. 1
Voucher.  INFLEXIBLE: station 5MFB.
Diagnosis.  Medium sized species; voucher specimens in two fragments; 12mm long (in total) and 0.8mm wide; with about 40 segments. Body elongated, cylindrical, tapering posteriorly; densely covered with papillae, covered with light brownish sediment; segmentation visible through sediment coat and papillation.
Anterior end broadly rounded, without cephalic cage; oral structures not visible (withdrawn); eyes absent. Parapodia not developed, chaetae appear to emerge directly from body wall. Notochaetae long,  slender, few (1-2 per ramus) observed, mostly missing; distally narrowed into long fine tip; appearing smooth (even under high magnification). Neurochaetae up to 5 per fascicle; all composite, with the blade falcate, slightly serrated along the edge, unidentate, with curved hinged tip. Pygidium damaged, not observed.
Remarks. Acrocirridae are well represented in the waters from the region (see table below; tables comparing all known species in genera Flabelligella and Flabelligena are available in Gillet (2001) and Aguirrezabalaga and Ceberio (2006). Gillet (2001) sates that genus Flabelligella has cross-barred notochaetae, while genus Flabelligena possesses serrated or spinulose notochaetae.  Cross-barred chaetae are not present in Falkland Island specimen, but neither spinulose or serrated chaetae were confirmed with certainty as chaetae appear more or less smooth even under high magnification. However these appear more allied to those of genus Flabelligena to which the specimen is assigned here. Many other characters separating the species within this group are difficult to observe as they tend to be withdrawn or missing. The specimen from Falkland Islands is here assigned to morphospecies Flabelligena sp. 1.

Voucher specimen. TOROA: station 10TFA.
Diagnosis. Specimens from 10TFA x 27 and 40 mm in length with 129 chaetigers and 187 chaetigers respectively. Long slender body with slight reddish colour in preserved specimens. Prostomium flattened with mid-dorsal furrow or depression, long, triangular, distally rounded. No eyes. Posterior chaetigers maldanid-like with a collar and distinct proximal edge. Parapodia small, with prechaetal lobes larger than prechaetal.
Mandibles small. Five pairs of maxillae; Max I with four teeth gradually decreasing in size distally; Max II with 8 – 12 teeth; Max III one long tooth anteriorly then 4 smaller teeth decreasing in size distally; Max IV one large tooth sometimes with 1 or 2 small teeth, Max V with one pointed tooth/edge. Maxillary carriers fused at anterior end with two long thin branches extending distally.
Chaetae simple limbates and large black aciculae.
Remarks. The maldanid-like form of the chaetigers in mid and posterior chaetigers is very distinctive. However, Orensanz (1990) remarks that this genus is not well studied so other species may share this characteristic.
This species has been recorded from the Falkland Islands and southern Atlantic slopes of South America at depths of 20–660 m.

Voucher specimen. SEALION: station 4MFA.
Diagnosis. Small species, voucher whole worm 7mm long with ~56 chaetigers. Rounded prostomium with a pair of short moniliform antennae; palps not observed (damaged?). Parapodia with notopodia represented by a pointed aciculum and neuropodia with a range of chaetae, dorsal cirri relatively long, about as long as parapodia, each with distinct terminal cirrostyle; ventral cirri short with rounded tip, situated toward outer end of parapodia.
Jaws with x-shaped mandibles, and maxillae composed of many elements.
Chaetae composed of capillaries with minute serration along one edge, compound falcigers with blades of varying lengths and bidentate tips, and asymmetric furcate chaetae, prongs widely separated.
Remarks. Distinguishing between the species of this genus is difficult because many of the characters change as the worm grows. Orensanz (1990) suggests that revision of the genus will require understanding how these characters are affected by development.

Voucher specimen. SEALION: station 22MFA.
Diagnosis. Specimen fragment 8.5mm long with 70 chaetigers. Prostomium elongated with pointed tip. Branchiae present as simple filaments from chaetiger 1.
Jaws (from Orensanz, 1990) Y-shaped mandibles, Max II with three distinct teeth, Max III and IV unidentate.
Chaetae simple limbate capillaries; simple hooded hooks, anterior chaetae intermediate with small fine hooks at the tip developing in mid to posterior chaetigers as distinctive hooded hooks. Black aciculae.
Remarks. The presence of transitory hook-like chaetae in anterior chaetigers resembles Ninoe falklandica, but P. antarctica can be distinguished by its lack of developed multi-filament branchiae on anterior chaetigers.
This species has been recorded previously from the Antarctic and Scotia Arc regions at depths of 365–3747 m.

Diagnosis. Specimen from 1MFC fragmented, 38mm with 117 chaetigers. Body large. Prostomium short, nearly as wide as long, pointed. Branchiae present, beginning around chaetiger 3 and extending to chaetiger 28-35, branchial filaments becoming well developed, with 4-6 filaments on chaetigers in the middle of this range.

Chaetae-simple hooks start on chaetiger 1 with long thin finely dentate tips, becoming more robust on distal chaetigers; with one main fang and 6-7 smaller teeth above.
Remarks. N. falklandica  can be distinguished from N. leptognatha Ehlers 1900, by the distribution of simple hooded hooks which start from chaetiger 1 in the former and much further back – chaetiger 25 or more – in the latter.

Diagnosis. Specimen from 14LFA 6mm long with 19 chaetigers. Prostomium elongated, conical with a rounded tip. No eyes.
Chaetae–hooded compound hooks from chaetiger 1 to 10, simple thereafter. Limbate geniculate chaetae present. Aciculae yellow.
Remarks. The worms in the study are very small and isolating and describing the inner jaws is difficult. The species of this complex are in any case difficult to distinguish, requiring careful examination of the maxillae, the distribution of compound hooded hooks and their length to width ratio (see Orensanz, 1990, for a detailed discussion).
The other species complex which might be found in the area is the L. magalhaensis complex. The L. kerguelensis/cingulata Group can be distinguished by the longer more pointed prostomium whereas the L. magalhaensis complex has a short rounded prostomium. Distribution of the L. kerguelensis/cingulata Group is Antarctic to Magellanic Province with a depth range of 0–2864 m.

Maxillae II with six teeth distal interior edge without teeth and about a quarter the total length; max III with one elongated ‘tooth’.
Chaetae: simple multidentate, hooded hooks from chaetiger 1; geniculate limbates; yellow aciculae.
Remarks. The specimen is small and fragmented making identification difficult. The distribution and type of hooded hooks together with the superficial examination of the jaws suggests that this might be a species of Errano. Confirmation will require examination of more material.

"Augeneria tentaculata Monro, 1930"," Augeneria tentaculata Monro, 1930
Voucher specimen. VINSON WEST: station 1MFB.
Diagnosis. Voucher specimen 9mm with 29 chaetigers. Body thick and robust. Prostomium a long cone with rounded tip. Nuchal papillae not observed (three median papillae often seen situated on the distal edge of the prostomium and peristomium).
Mandibles flat, white, X-shaped. Max I with large distal extension; Max II with three low teeth; Max III concave inner surface; Max IV larger than III, irregularly rectangular, white in centre; Max V missing.
Hooded hooks compound in anterior chaetigers 1–13 becoming simple thereafter.
Remarks. Orensanz (1990) remarks that the genus needs to be revised and does not provide a key to species in the Southern Ocean. This species appears to be distinct based on the shape of the maxillae, distribution of the hooded hooks and the transition from compound to simple chaetae. Further study of the various species is required to determine taxonomic boundaries. Nominally, A. tenaculata has been recorded from Antarctic seas, the slope off South America at depths of 80–2350 m.

Voucher specimen: SEALION: station 1MFC and 8MFA; TOROA: station T5FB; INFLEXIBLE: station 2MFA.
Diagnosis. Specimens fragmented, Sealion 1MFC specimen ~30mm in length with 175 chaetigers. Prostomium short, pointed. Two achaetigerous segments. Postchaetal lobes conical, short.
Maxillary carriers constricted about a quarter way down, pointed and pips separated; Max I large arched without supplementary teeth, Max II with three to four large teeth; Max III small semi-triangular with small tooth at apex near junction with Max IV. Max V and VI fused forming a broad rectangular plate, small tooth emerges from inner border of the plate.
Chaetae comprise of hooded hooks, limbate capillaries, and yellow aciculae. The hooded hooks arise from chaetiger 1 or slightly further back, initial chaetae resemble limbates but have small teeth/hooks developing at the tip. Hooded hooks become distinct in distal anterior chaetigers, characterised by main fang with approximately four or more secondary teeth.
Remarks. The key features of this species as pointed out by Orensanz (1990) are the very delicate hooded hooks in the anterior chaetigers which can only be distinguished by examination with a high powered microscope and by the fusion of Max IV and V. This species has a wide geographic and bathymetric distribution, being recorded from around the Southern Ocean, off New Zealand and Chile, with a depth range of upper bathyal to 6000 m.

Voucher specimen. Sealion 4MFB
Large species, 17mm long with approximately 57 chaetigers. Body inflated anteriorly, with dorsal groove in mid to posterior thoracic region. There is a slight gutter formed on each side of the anterior chaetigers at the junction of the parapodia and the dorsal part of the segment. Abdominal region dorso-ventrally flattened.
Prostomium conical bluntly pointed. Peristomium shorter wider than long with three difficult to distinguish annulations. Dorsal tentacles on edge of peristomium with first branchiae lateral or slightly distal to dorsal tentacles; subsequent branchiae in line situated dorsally to notochaetae.
Chaetae all simple capillaries. Thoracic notochaetae all about the same length, one to two chaetigers; 4 to 6 per fascicule; thoracic neurochaetae similar length to notochaetae, 5 to 7 per fascicule. Abdominal chaetae similar length to thoracic chaetae but with fewer in each fascicule.
Pygidium with lobes, ventral lobe larger than others.
MGSP. Band of stain at junction of prostomium and peristomium with another band on the distal peristomium.
Remarks. This is a distinctive species easily separated from the other Aphelochaeta species recorded from the Falkland Islands by its body shape and staining pattern. In terms of the species found in the region, this species differs from A. longisetosa Hartman-Schröder (1965) in the short length of its chaetae, the shape of the prostomium. A. malefica Elias & Rivero, 2009 also has long chaetae and there is a crest on the peristomium which is not present in A. sp. 7. The body shape of the latter species also differs from the Mar del Plata species being large and somewhat inflated.

Voucher. SEALION: stations 6MFC, 10MFB, 17MFA, 31MFA and 44MFB.
Diagnosis. Sealion specimen 17 MFA anterior fragment 14.1mm in length with 127 chaetigers. Body widening gradually in thorax then narrowing at junction with abdomen; dorsally flattened; ventrally a shallow groove runs from the mid to posterior thorax down body. Thoracic chaetigers much wider than long, crowded, in abdomen chaetigers longer, as wide as long or longer, before becoming crowded on the segments in the pygidium.
Prostomium wide, conical with rounded or ‘stumpy’ point. Peristomium as wide as long, domed; 3 annulations, first two obvious in lateral and ventral view, third complete dorsally and extending distally into the first chaetiger. Dorsal tentacles situated on proximal edge of peristomium, dorsal to and on the same level or slightly anterior to the first branchiae; second branchial pair close to first pair.
Chaetae all simple capillaries, thoracic notochaetae of two basic lengths–relatively short capillaries about 4 chaetigers in length or equivalent to half the chaetiger width, and longer chaetae of at least 10 chaetigers length; long chaetae arising from posterior thoracic region occurring in subsequent chaetigers into the abdominal region; 6­-10 chaetae per fascicle sometime appears as if in two groups. Thoracic neurochaetae short capillaries, similar in length to short capillaries in the notopodial; 5-6 chaetae per fascicle. Abdominal notochaetae longer than those neuropodia, smaller numbers of chaetae in abdominal fascicles than in thorax.
Pygidium with last 18 segments expanded, anal opening with lobes, ventralmost lobe largest, blunt and extended.
Methyl Green Staining Pattern. Band ventral under the prostomium extending into the mouth, narrow bands along lateral and ventral edges of thoracic chaetigers.
Remarks. Aphelochaeta sp. 5fB is a common species in the Sealion samples. It closely resembles A. sp. 5fA, differing in being more dorso-ventrally flattened and in the arrangement of the third annulation and dorsal tentacles. In mixed samples this species can often be distinguished by a full gut obvious in posterior thoracic and anterior abdominal chaetigers and, in fresh material, by the bases of branchiae in the posterior thorax showing as bright red dots.
A. sp. 5fB can be distinguished from the Aphelochaeta malefica Elias and Rivero, 2009 by the arrangement of the dorsal tentacles, third annulation of the peristomium and MGSP. There are similarities to Aphelochaeta longisetosa (Hartmann-Schröder, 1960) but there appears to be differences in the arrangement of the annualtions and dorsal tentacles, however there are no images for this species and so definitive assessment can only be made after examination of the type. The shape of the body suggests similarities with Aphelochaeta williamsae Blake, 1996 from California but the FI specimen differ in MGSP which have banding extending laterally while in A. williamsae they do not. A. sp. 5fB differs from the other Californian species in that the dorsal thorax is flattened and ventrally more rounded, whereas most of Blake’s species are dorsal-ventrally rounded or have a rounded (hump-backed) dorsal thoracic shape.

Diagnosis. Sealion specimen 16 MFC fragment 16.3mm long with 79 chaetigers, 60 MFA 11mm long with 67 chaetigers. Body widening gradually in thorax region, dorsally hump-backed, thoracic chaetigers crowded, narrow, wider than long, becoming longer and more flaccid in abdominal chaetigers but again becoming wider than long towards pygidium; ventrally, groove present from mid thorax down the body.
Prostomium conical, blunt-pointed. Peristomium wider than long, domed, three annulations seen laterally and horizontally. Dorsal tentacles separated, situated laterally on distal edge of peristomium and first chaetiger, dorsal and proximal to first branchiae. Following branchiae situated dorsal to notochaetae separated by at least one branchial diameter from dorsalmost notochaetae.
Chaetae positioned laterally in thoracic segments but becoming more ventral in subsequent segments. Thoracic chaetae relatively long thin capillaries; notochaetae of two sizes, long capillaries of approximately up to 10 chaetigers in length, giving specimens a ‘hairy’ appearance, long chaetae appear from anterior thoracic chaetigers and occur down body into the abdominal chaetigers, shorter capillaries less than 6 chaetigers in length also present; thoracic neurochaetae slightly shorter; 7 to 10 notochaetae and 6 to 8 neurochaetae per fascicle. Abdominal notochaetae fewer in number than neurochaetae and less dense than in thoracic chaetigers.
Pygidial segments widening before narrowing and tapering towards anus, distinct ventral groove observed, terminal anus with low lobes, ventral lobe large extending with an acute tip.
MGSP. Band or spot on ventral prostomial region extending into mouth, diffuse staining on sides of peristomium, distinct partial bands ventrally on thoracic chaetigers along edges of the chaetigers, becoming more dense in mid and proximal thoracic chaetigers, some banding dorsally on thoracic chaetigers.
Remarks. Aphelochaeta sp. 5fA is common in the Sealion samples. It closely resembles A. sp. 5fB having similar MGSP but differs in the shape of the body, with A. sp. 5fA having a hump-backed thorax while in A. sp. 5fB the thorax is flat; long notochaetae occur from the anterior chaetigers of A. sp. 5fA but in A. sp. 5fB such long chaetae are found in posterior thoracic chaetigers. Such differences appear to be consistent and so it has been decided to consider them as separate species. Further specimens and genetic analyses are probably needed to confirm their status.
In terms of known Aphelochaeta species, A. sp. 5fA differs from A. malefica Elias and Rivero 2009, in the body shape which expands in thoracic chaetigers of the FI specimen while the species from the River Plate has a body more uniform in width, the peristomium is much shorter in the FI specimens only as long as wide whereas in A. malefica the peristomium is longer that wide in the position of the dorsal tentacles and first branchiae and that the latter also has the peristomium extending back displacing the first chaetiger, while A. sp. 5fA the junction is not displaced proximally. The MGSP for the two species is also different. The FI specimens have only diffuse staining in the peristomium and prostomium while A. malefica has these areas darkly stained.
A. sp. 5fA appears to resemble the description given by Hartmann-Schröder (1960) for A. longisetosa. However, there were no images provided and some of the descriptions of the characters are not sufficient to distinguish or otherwise the two species. It has been decided to maintain them as separate until it is possible to examine the types.
Distribution. Recorded from the NW Falkland Islands at depths of 400 – 500 m.

The FI specimen differs from A. longisetosa on the position of the dorsal tentacles which in the Chilean species are more lateral and separated, close to the chaetae; the notochaetae are longer than the neuro while in the FI specimens they are approximately the same length. Hartmann-Schröder does not provide any information on the methyl green staining patterns–a technique which has only become common in the last decade. The FI species differs from A. malefica because the peristomium does not extend back into the first chaetiger as in the specimens from the River Plate. Also the MGSP differs between the two species.
Distribution. Found around the Falkland Islands from the upper bathyal (400 m) to mid-slope (1500 m).

Chaetozone? sp. 9

Voucher specimen SEALION: station 39MFA; RHEA1.

Diagnosis. Specimens incomplete, 9.5mm long with 47 chaetigers. Body dorso-ventrally flattened, widening distally, weak ventral furrow extending distally for initial chaetigers, no dorsal furrow. Pygidium not observed.
Prostomium conical, bluntly pointed. Peristomium domed and extending back displacing the annulations and achaetigerous segment. Annulations not easy to distinguish dorsally, appears to be three ventrally, foremost annulation forming peristomial dome and extending back. Dorsal tentacles arising laterally and extending dorsally on either side of the peristomial projection, dorsal tentacles situated on distalmost annulation. First branchiae arising on an achaetigerous segment proximal to chaetiger 1, positioned on the edge of the segment on the same level as the dorsal tentacles.
Thoracic chaetae all relatively short capillaries, 5-7 in the noto- and neuropodia, approximately three chaetigers in length. Short, banana-shaped, chaetae in anterior abdominal chaetigers, with long thin pointed tips. 
MGSP. Very distinctive pattern with stain bands at base of prostomium, around the mouth on the domed annulation of the peristomium and forming dark bands laterally in each chaetiger.
Remarks. The lack of distal chaetigers makes designation of this species as a Chaetozone difficult. The main character which suggest it belongs to Chaetozone are the banana-shaped chaetae in the abdomen which are often seen in other species in proximal abdominal chaetigers. The shape of the prostomium is reminiscent of Chaetozone and the domed extension of the peristomium has been recorded in several Chaetozone species, i.e. C. bathyala Blake, 2015 C. bansei Blake, 1996, C. gracilis (Moore, 1923), C. hedgpethi Blake, 1996. However, such a topology is not restricted to Chaetozone, with species of Caulleriella and Monticellina also having a domed peristomial extending back. Definitive identification will require complete specimens and thus we have left the designation as Chaetozone?.

Chaetozone sp. 8

Voucher specimens. SEALION: stations 3MFB and 17MFB.

Diagnosis. Reaching relatively large size, with voucher specimen (3MFB) 14.7mm in length with 142 chaetigers. Body slightly dorso-ventrally flattened, gradually widening in thoracic chaetigers, distal abdominal chaetigers concertina-like with prominent edge to chaetiger; ventral groove present from anterior thoracic chaetigers down body. Body not pigmented.
Prostomium and peristomium distinct and separated from thoracic region. Eyes absent. Prostomium, short, conical and pointed with a rounded tip. Peristomium, short, as wide as long, domed or with crest over peristomium; with three compressed annulations, difficult to see, particularly dorsally. Dorsal tentacles situated in junction between peristomium and thorax, dorsally situated on the third annulation and proximal to first branchiae. Branchiae situated dorsal to notochaetae found in thoracic chaetigers, less obvious in anterior abdominal chaetigers.
Chaetae comprise capillaries in anterior chaetae, with long thickened spines occurring in abdominal region of the body, from approximately chaetiger 79 (in voucher 17MFB). Thoracic notochaetae up to 3–5 chaetigers in length; 7 to 9 capillaries per fascicle; neurochaetae shorter with 9 to 11 capillaries per fascicle. Abdominal chaetigers with mixture of simple capillaries and thickened spines carried on low ridges, fascicles separated dorsally and ventrally, notopodial with two dorsal capillaries and three long pointed spines, while neuropodia with 6 or more elongated thin spines.
Pygidium is a rounded plate-like disk.
MSGP. Specimens heavily stain, prostomium and peristomium stain with only a narrow band of light or no stain between; body with obvious bands both dorsally, laterally and ventrally on the edge of the chaetigers.
Remarks. This species is easily recognised by its distinctive body shape with the appearance of distinct pro- and peristomium, the MGSP, and the arrangement of the abdominal parapodia and chaetae. The shape of the body resembles C. bathyala (Blake, 2015) but differs in lacking the ventral ridge observed in Blake’s species, the form and fascicular arrangement of the spines and the peristomial region is more elongate in C. bathyala. The presence of a dome or crest over the peristomium is shared with C. setosa Malmgren, 1867; C. corona Berkeley and Berkeley, 1941; C. platycera Hutchings and Murray, 1984 and C. pugettensis Blake, 2015. The FI specimen can be distinguished from all these species by its characteristic MGSP, for example C. pugettensis a staining pattern is absent while dorsal staining in the thoracic chaetigers of the FI species is not as prominent in C. setosa.

Chaetozone sp. 6

Voucher specimen. SEALION: station 5MFB.
Diagnosis. Sealion 5MFB specimen is a fragment, 5.9mm long with 37 chaetigers. Body slightly dorso-ventrally flattened, anterior not widening distally; dorsal  surface flat with dorsal gutters at boundary of notochaetae and dorsal surface; anterior abdominal chaetigers concertina-shaped. Pygidium not observed.
Prostomium conical with pointed tip. Peristomium longer than wide, with three broad annulations; slightly domed, obscuring the annulations dorsally. Dorsal tentacles situated on distal edge of peristomium, appearing to be displaced distally when viewed dorsally; first branchiae difficult to distinguish but situated lateral to the dorsal tentacles and just dorsal to the notochaetae of the first chaetiger, not situated on an achaetigerous segment; subsequent branchiae lie above notochaetae.
Thoracic chaetae capillaries, 4–5 chaetigers in length, up to 11 in the notopodia and 7–8 in neuropodia. Spine-like chaetae in anterior segments but acicular spines not observed in this fragment.
MGSP. No obvious staining pattern, diffuse over the anterior.
Remarks. Chaetozone sp. 6 differs from the other Falkland Islands Chaetozone species by the long peristomium with large annulations, the position of the dorsal tentacles in relation to the first branchiae and chaetiger, the body shape and the form of the acicular chaetae in the distal chaetigers.
Chaetozone sp. 6 differs from the other species recorded in the region by the way the position of the dorsal tentacles in relationship to the first branchiae and the first chaetiger. C. sp. 6 is not as inflated in the body as C. pinguis Hartman, 1978. The FI species lacks the curved acicular spines observed by Hartmann-Schröder (1965) for C. curvata. Chaetozone sp. 3 differs from C. andersenensis (Augener 1932) in the shape of the prostomium which is acutely pointed but blunt in the latter species, and the shape of the body which is dorsally flattened in the FI specimen but rounded in Augener’s species.

Chaetozone sp. 4

Voucher specimen. LOLIGO: station LFA3.

Diagnosis. Specimen incomplete, 5.5cm long with 35 chaetigers. Body slightly flattened dorso-ventrally, widening only gradually, mid portion of body inflated poorly segmented, posterior abdominal chaetigers concertina like; shallow ventral groove from distal thoracic chaetigers, also weak groove/furrow starting in abdominal chaetigers to end of fragment. Pygidium not observed.
Prostomium and peristomium forming a distinctly triangular appearance. Prostomium triangular with a pointed tip. Peristomium as wide as long, with two distinct annulations, the anterior as wide as long, while the posterior is wider than long. Dorsal tentacles arise laterally in posterior of second annulation. First branchiae situated on an achaetigerous segment immediately distal to the dorsal tentacles. Subsequent branchiae in line with first and situated above the notochaetae.
Thoracic chaetae all capillaries, with two lengths short about 3 chaetigers in length and one or two long ones in excess of 10 chaetigers in length; 5-6 chaetae in notopodia and 4-6 in neuropodia. In proximal abdominal chaetigers notopodia with long and short capillaries. Neuropodia with short, pointed, spine-like capillaries and acicular spines, aciculars occurring in the posterior part of the specimen (possibly about one third down the total body). In proximal chaetigers the acicular and pointed capillaries alternate in position down the fascicule. Acicular spines not observed in the notopodia of the incomplete specimen.
MGSP. No distinct patterns, prostomium does not stain and the remainder of the body only diffusely stains.
Remarks. The distinct body shape of this species, specifically the triangular anterior, separates it from the other FI specimens and from other species recorded from the region. The lack of methyl green staining pattern also marks the species as distinct from Chaetozone sp. 1, sp. 2, sp. 3, sp. 8 and sp. 9. It differs from Chaetozone sp. 6 in the arrangement of the dorsal tentacles which in C. sp. 6 are laterally placed on the peristomium and appear to lie above the first chaetiger.
The presence of a complete achaetigerous segment on which arise the first branchiae is similar to the arrangement found in a number of Chaetozone species (see table in Blake 2015). However the lack of the posterior chaetigers restricts comparison with other species.

Voucher specimen. Sealion 15 MFA, 12 MFC, 2 MFB

Diagnosis. Specimen from 15 MFA complete, 8mm in length with approximately 70 chaetigers. Body slightly flattened dorso-ventrally, widening gradually becoming widest in distal thoracic chaetigers, dorsal groove present in some specimens, mid-section inflated and segmentation poorly defined, distal abdominal chaetigers flattened dorso-ventrally and becoming concertina-shaped; pygidium with four rounded lobes, ventral lobes joined at their bases.
Prostomium sharply pointed. Peristomium short wider than long, with three annulations. Dorsal tentacle bases arising laterally on peristomium extending and emerging dorsally. First branchiae arising on an achaetigerous segment, situated lateral to where dorsal tentacles emerge dorsally; subsequent branchiae in line with first branchiae or slightly more ventral, above the notochaetae.
Chaetae in thoracic segments capillaries, short about 2 to 3 chaetigers in length. Acicular spines starting about half way down body, slightly curved with rounded or blunt tips, spines alternating with short, thin, acutely-pointed chaetae, three to five spines in a fascicule, similar arrangement in both noto- and neuropodia although notochaetae may be slightly longer; fascicules separated, not forming cinctures.
MGSP. Stain band at base of prostomium, diffuse stain on peristomium.
Remarks. Chaetozone sp. 3 can be distinguished from other FI Chaetozone species, particularly Chaetozone sp. 2, by the arrangement of the dorsal tentacle the base of which arises laterally and extends dorsally, the peristomium region is not domed, the capillary chaetae of the thoracic chaetigers are short and abdominal chaetae not forming cintures.
Chaetozone sp. 3 differs from the other species recorded in the region by the way the dorsal tentacles emerge. The FI species lacks the curved acicular spines observed by Hartmann-Schröder (1965) for C. curvatus. Chaetozone sp. 3 differs from C. andersenensis (Augener 1932) in the shape of the prostomium which is acutely pointed but blunt in the latter species.

Diagnosis. 37MFA specimen fragmented, 8.5mm long with approximately 62 chaetigers. Body widens in thorax to junction with abdomen. Mid-body slightly inflated with less defined segmentation; distal abdominal chaetigers moniliform. Pygidium with rounded ventral lobe.
Prostomium conical and pointed. Peristomium domed, short, wider than long, annulation difficult to see. Dorsal tentacles situated on distal edge of peristomium, dorsal to first branchiae; first branchiae on achaetigerous segment proximal to first chaetigerous segment. Subsequent branchiae in line with first and situated above notochaetae.
Thoracic chaetae all capillaries; notochaetae with some long capillaries, up to 9 chaetigers in length, approximately 7 per fascicule, neuropodial capillaries shorter, some very much shorter to 2 chaetigers in length, 5 to 7 per fascicule. Proximal abdominal chaetigers with short, curved, pointed spine-like chaetae in neuropodia and longer spine-like chaetae in notopodia together with occasional long capillaries. Acicular spines starting about half to two thirds down body, distally forming complete cinctures; a mix of acicular and more slender thin tipped chaetae, no particular pattern observed.
MGSP. Dark stained band on prostomium, diffuse over rest of body.
Remarks. Chaetozone sp. 2 differs from the other FI Chaetozone species in the MGSP, the arrangement of the dorsal tentacles and first branchiae and the arrangement of the spines in abdominal chaetigers.
In terms of species recorded in the region, Chaetozone sp. 2 differs from Chaetozone pinguis Hartman 1978, in body shape which is not as inflated as Hatman’s species and the prostomium is pointed not blunt. The acicular spines on Chaetozone sp. 2 are not recurved as described by Hartmann-Schröder (1965) for C. curvata. Augener’s (1932) species C. andersenensis was based on a specimen which was not in good condition so comparison is difficult. Augener describes the dorsal tentacle as arising on the boundary between the peristomium and chaetiger 1, with the first branchiae on chaetiger 1. This pattern differs from Chaetozone sp.2 where the first branchiae occurs on an achaetigerous segment. Augener also describes the prostomium as being pushed forward with a blunt tip similar to Cirratulus cirratulus. The prostomium in the FI specimens is pointed.

Chaetozone sp. 1

Voucher specimens INFLEXIBLE: station 2MFA; ENDEAVOUR: station E4FA.

Diagnosis. Complete specimens 8.3mm long with 34 chaetigers. Body inflated anteriorly, widest at junction of thoracic and abdominal chaetigers; anterior abdominal chaetigers rounded becoming slightly dorso-ventrally flattened segments. Ventral groove in posterior thoracic region (may be a fold due to inflated body). Pygidium with large rounded ventral lobe.
Prostomium rounded, blunt. Peristomium as long as wide or slightly longer than wide, with three annulations. Dorsal tentacle situated on a narrow achaetigerous segment immediately distal to peristomium; first branchiae situated on same achaetigerous segment but ventral to dorsal tentacle. Branchiae situated above notochaetae.
Thoracic chaetae all capillaries; emerging from low mounds, short approximately 2 to 3 chaetigers in length, 4 to 6 chaetae in each fascicule in thoracic region. Acicular spines starting about one third to half way down the body; not forming cinctures in distal chaetigers, fascicules are separated; 3 to 4 long spines per fascicule with one to two thin capillaries in proximal abdominal chaetigers, but distal chaetigers without capillaries.
MGSP. Faint bands on prostomium and peristomium, diffuse staining on body.
Remarks. This is a distinctively shaped species, in particular the blunt shape of the prostomium and the inflated body are not often found in Chaetozone. However, the form and arrangement of the dorsal tentacles and first branchiae on an achetigerous segment is commonly found in the genus as are the acicular spines in abdominal chaetigers. The shape of the body and prostomium separate this species from the others in the FI samples.
Chaetozone sp. 1 resembles Chaetozone pinguis Hartman, 1978 in the shape of the body and rounded prostomium. However C. sp. 1 does not have the acicular spines starting in the thoracic chaetigers as Hartman records for C. pinguis nor is the arrangement of dorsal tentacle and first branchiae the same.

"Cirratulidae sp. 1"," Cirratulidae sp. 1
Vouchers. SEALION: stations 1MFB and 18MFB.
Diagnosis. Large species, 106mm long 10mm wide. Dorso-ventrally flattened and tapering at each end to a blunt point, body wide with crowded chaetigers, much wider than long, no obvious differentiation between thoracic and abdominal regions, dorsal groove/furrow proximally. Ridge running down mid-line in abdominal chaetigers. Rear end of body tapering sharply, pygidium simple terminal surrounded by low lobes.
Prostomium wide, with rounded free edge. Prostomium with three annulations, approximately the same size. One pair of dorsal tentacles situated laterally on the first chaetiger, lying dorsal to the notochaetae. First branchiae on chaetiger 2. Subsequent branchiae in line with first, extending down only on anterior third part of body.
Chaetae all simple capillaries arising on low buttons in anterior chaetigers. Notochaetae both long and short chaetae; long chaetae up to 9+ chaetigers in length, very thin and flexible with fine tips; short chaetae slightly thicker. Only short capillaries in neurochaetae, with fine serrations along edge; 5–6 chaetae in noto and neuropodia.
MGSP. Solid stain over the dorsal prostomium and peristomial areas; ventrally on the prostomium a band runs into the mouth; band of stain on each chaetiger, particularly strong over the parapodia area.
Remarks. Despite this species being large and in some samples common, placing it  in a genus has been difficult. Superficially it resembles a multi-branchiate species of Cirratulus. There are species of Cirratulus which have reduced or only one pair of dorsal tentacles, e.g C. concinnus Ehlers, 1908. However, species of Cirratulus have distinct spines in the neuropodia whereas this species has none. Using available keys results in an identification of Aphelochaeta – the pair of dorsal tentacles and only capillary chaetae. Yet the FI species’ over all appearance is unlike any Aphelochaeta species. More work is needed and comparison with other cirratulid species in the area is required to resolve this dilemma.

Tharyx cf. epitoka Monro, 1930

Voucher specimens. VINSON WEST: stations 38MFA, 1MFA and 1MFB.

Diagnosis. Specimen incomplete, 9mm with 23 chaetigers. Body cylindrical, slightly inflated at junction between thoracic and abdominal regions, no gutters/furrows observed, dorsal surface slightly raised. Pygidium not observed.
Prostomium blunt, wide and short. In some specimens nuchal organs observed. Peristomium slightly longer than wide with three similar sized annulations. Dorsal tentacles situated dorsally arising on the edge of the peristomium. First branchiae not on an achaetigerous segment but arising on chaetiger 1. Subsequent branchiae align with first branchiae.
Chaetae in first chaetigers short about 1 to 2 chaetigers in length, subsequent chaetigers with a mix of long and short chaetae, 6-7 capillaries in each fascicule. Long chaetae also found on abdominal chaetigers but in lower numbers than thoracic chaetigers. No modified chaetae observed.
MGSP. Prostomium and peristomium deeply stain, except the nuchal organs and ventrally around the mouth, distinct lateral bands in proximal chaetigers, gradually fading in distal chaetigers; ventrally the bands extend across the body but with a distinct clear y-shaped region running down from each side of the mouth and joining in the mid-line.
Remarks. The specimens from the current study agree in basic shape with the type of Tharyx epitoka Monro, 1930. However, Monro’s specimen is very obviously an epitoke as it is full of eggs whereas the FI specimens are not. In both the FI specimens and the holotype no modified chaetae were observed which calls into question the generic designation of the species.
The body-shape of this species, the staining pattern and the chaetal signature distinguish this species from the other FI cirratulids.

Update: Blake (2016) published descriptions of several new species of Cirratulidae from worldiwide areas, including Southern Ocean. 

The following genera with a single pair of dorsal tentacles were recorded in this study (full keys are given in Blake 1996):
Chaetozone – species with stout acicular chaetae in abdominal chaetigers, sometimes forming complete cinctures.
Caulleriella – species with distinct bidentate chaetae.
Aphelochaeta – simple capillaries throughout.
Tharyx – chaetae with knob-shaped terminal ends.

Genera with several pairs of dorsal tentacles with other kinds of chaetae recorded in this study:
Dodecaceria – spines with curved or spoon-shaped endings.
Cirratulus – simple spines, multiple eyes on prostomium

Phyllodocidae collected from Falkland Islands represent species-rich group with at least 10 species (including one species complex) recorded. However, their abundances are low, with each species often represent by one or few specimens, often in imperfect condition (those from deeper-waters often small and fragile). The identification and corresponding descriptions reflect the paucity of well-preserved material and therefore contain some uncertainties. More material, including live specimens (for taxonomic importance if pigmentation in live specimens see Nygren and Pleijel, 2011) as well as molecular evidence will be necessary to fully diagnose these species. Proboscis was dissected (due to rarity and fragility of specimen) and was only observed when everted.  Key given by Pleijel (1993) was used to identify Phyllodocidae to genus level.

Recent taxonomic work revealed many new species of Trichobranchidae (particularly in genus Terebellides Sars, 1835), from worldwide areas (e.g. Hutchings and Peart, 2000; Gagaev, 2009; Parapar et al., 2011; Parapar et al. 2015), including South America and South Atlantic (Bremec and Elias, 1999; Schüller and Hutchings, 2012). Revisionary works clarified the status of Terebellides stroemii (Parapar and Hutchings, 2015) as well as some commonly reported species from the Southern Ocean (Parapar and Moreira, 2008). New characters were identified or gained importance (Hutchings and Peart, 2000). There is therefore up to date taxonomic information available, although new species are likely to be discovered. Falkland Island specimens of Trichobranchidae were sadly often damaged and in bad condition, preventing unambiguous identifications/conclusions. The diversity of this group in Falkland Islands is likely much higher than species reported here, particularly in small-sized species from 1000m depths. The species recorded are summarized in table below.

Sphaerodoropsis sp. 3 
Voucher. SEA LION: station 9MFC.
Diagnosis.  Small-sized species; voucher specimen short and spindle-shaped; 1.2mm long and 0.3mm wide 13 chaetigers.
Prostomium with five digitiform appendages, including a pair of palps, in ventralmost position; a pair of lateral antenna, similar in shape and size to palps; and a median antenna, shorter (two thirds) than lateral antennae and club-shaped; a pair of tentacular cirri similar in shape and size to lateral antennae and palps.
One transverse rows of macrotubercles per chaetiger. Four sessile and distally rounded, enlarged globular macrotubercles per row; macrotubercles arranged in groups of 2, each group located dorsal to parapodia; macrotubercles rather indistinct, low lying.
Dorsum sparsely covered with small papillae, arranged in 2 more or less regular rows across each segment, about 5-6 papilla per row. Venter covered with scattered small papillae, arrangement similar to the one in dorsum.
Uniramous parapodia elongated, cylindrical; ventral cirri well developed, digiform. Parapodial papillae present; exact arrangement not established, but at least 3 small papillae easily observed.
Chaetae compound, unidentate, about 8 per fascicle.
Pygidium with digiform mid-ventral anal cirrus and a pair of lateral anal cirri.
Remarks. This species belongs to the largest group in genus Spaherodoropsis (species with 4 rows of macrotubercles). Careful comparison of papillation of venter and parapodia with known species will be necessary to establish the identity of this species. It resembles S. parva  (Ehlers, 1913) but Falkland Island specimen differs in lack of eyes as well as greater level of papillation. Until further study we have assigned this species to morphospecies Sphaerodoropsis sp. 3.

Voucher. ENDEAVOUR: station 9MFA.
Diagnosis.  Small sized but robust species; voucher specimen short and maggot-like; 2.2mm long and 1mm wide for about 25 chaetigers. Prostomium inconspicuous.
Two transverse rows of macrotubercles per chaetiger. About 15 sessile and distally rounded, globular macrotubercles in each row; macrotubercles relatively small, mostly of similar size, tightly packed, arranged in a zigzag to regular pattern on dorsum (dorsum almost completely covered); distally macrotubercle with a small red spot, internally a red stalk observed through integument; additional single row of such macrotubercles also present ventrally to parapodia, in a few segments two such macrotubercles present ventrally.
Uniramous parapodia extremely short, cylindrical with; ventral cirri short, digiform. Chaetal fascicles arranged in a curved transverse row behind acicular lobe, numbering 6–10 chaetae per fascicle.
All chaetae semi-compound; blades as long as wide; with an outer distal thin spine in some chaetae; shaft with widened distal end and saw-toothed spinulation, continuing along most of blade length. Pygidium inconspicuous.
Remarks. This species in easy to distinguish by a very high number of macrotubercle (around 15), which are slightly smaller than in most other species. Although Sphaerodropsis represent a genus with large number of species, only few species possess such a large number of macrotubercles as well as similar type of chaetae. These include: S. minuta (Webster & Benedict, 1887); S. spissum (Benham, 1921); S. multipupillata (Hartmann-Schroder, 1974); S. paracapense (Hartmann-Schroder, 1974) and S. polypapillata Hartmann-Schroder & Rosenfeldt ,1988, with the latter species described from the Southern Ocean. Falkland Island specimen appears to differ in possessing reddish pigmentation distally on macrotubercles. Further work will be needed to compare type material of existing species, but it is likely that Falkland Island specimens represents a new species. For now, we assign this specimen to morphospecies Sphaerodoropsis sp. 2.

Voucher. INFLEXIBLE: station 4MFB.
Diagnosis.  Small sized species; voucher specimen short and maggot-like, tapering anteriorly and posteriorly; 2mm long and 0.3mm wide for 15 chaetigers. Six sessile and distally rounded, enlarged globular macrotubercles in each of the two transverse rows per chaetiger; macrotubercles spread out (not tightly packed) in a zig-zag pattern on dorsum (dorsum easily visible); the lateralmost macrotubercles often smaller than others. Uniramous parsapodia short, cylindrical with basal papillae; ventral cirri short, digiform; chaetae compound, unidentate. Venter covered with scattered small papillae and with one large rounded papilla on ventral to parapodia of chaetiger 6.
Remarks. Falkland Island specimens belong to group of Sphaerodoropsis with more than 4 rows of macrotubercles (Borowski, 1994). Several species with similar number and arrangement of macrotubercle are known, including those known from the region. Important characters that differentiate between species, related to number and patterns formed by papillae on ventrum and parapodia (see Moreira et al., 2004 for details). While papillae on the ventrum of  Falkland Islands are present, further work would be needed (ideally with the help of SEM) to establish their pattern and compare this with the known species. For now, we assign this specimen to morphospecies  Sphaerodoropsis sp. 1.

Ventral cirri about as long as postchaetal lobes; parapodia without papillae; chaetae compound, unidentate. Pygidium with medioventral anal papilla about as long as lateral cirri.
Remarks. Falkland Island specimens strongly resemble Sphaerodoropsis macrotubercula Böggemann, 2009 described from Angola Basin, 5493m. Currently there are no obvious morphological characters that could distinguish between two morphotypes, with the biggest difference being their bathymetrical distribution. We are unable to currently resolve if these represent the same species without the help of molecular data.

Papillae covering dorsum sparsely distributed, forming regular rows across dorsum; about 2 papillae between macro- and microtubercle and then about 10 papillae across the dorsum; the number of rows these papillae form difficult to ascertain (at least 2 easily observed).
Parapodia uniramous; conical. Parapodia of first chaetiger in ventral position; following parapodia lateral. Digitiform chaetal lobe, arising dorsally among chaetae, projecting beyond acicular lobe. Ventral cirri digiform, surpassing acicular lobe tip. Parapodia with about 10 small papillae, sparsely distributed on all surfaces. Recurved hooks in first chaetiger (one per parapodium), visible in ventral view. Chaetae about 4 per fascicle, almost all broken off, few remaining ones appear compound.

Remarks. Generic assignment of this specimen is uncertain due to lack of clearly observable chaetae. Genera Sphaerodorum Örsted, 1843 and Ephesiella Chamberlin, 1919 differ in simple chaetae in the former and compound chaetae in the latter. The specimen here is currently assigned to genus Ephesiella Chamberlin, 1919 as few remaining chaetae appeared compound (although these were imbedded in the integument). These genera are represented in the region by two species: Ephesiella antarctica (McIntosh, 1885),  Ephesiella muhlenhardtae Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1988 and Sphaerodorum olgae Moreira & Parapar, 2011. A better preserved specimen (with chaetae) from Falkland Islands, as well as the type specimens of the Ephesiella species need to be examined in order to establish the papillation of body surface and parapodia. For now, this species is assigned to morphospecies Ephesiella? sp. 1.

Vouchers. VINSON WEST: station 4MFA and HERO: station 1 MFA.
Diagnosis. Both vouchers incomplete, the better preserved voucher (VINSON WEST 4MFA) 2.5 mm long, 0.8 mm wide (including parapodia) for 15 segments. Pharynx not extended. All elytra missing.
Prostomium oval, wider than long, with stout cylindrical ceratophore of median antenna bearing small lateral auricles, style missing; lateral antennae(?) very short lobes. Tentacular parapodium with single aciculum and bundles of extremely long, slender capillary chaetae; tentacular cirri with distinct cirrophores; styles slender tapering, of unequal length with dorsal tentacular cirri about 1/3 the length of ventral ones. Eyes absent. Palps long, extending to about segment 10, very slender, tapering.
Segment 2 with inflated elytrophores. Segment with pair of short bulbous cirrophores (?); styles missing (?). No branchiae observed.  No parapodial ctenidia observed, but ventral ctenidia observed from about chaetiger 13. Parapodia distinctly biramous; stylodes absent.
Notopodia only slightly smaller than neuropodia, long, cylindrical; with distinct supraacicular process  - short, rounded, blunt. Neuropodia long, cylindrical. Ventral cirri of 2nd segment inserted basally on neuropodium, longer than in subsequent segments (almost reaching tip of neuropodium); on other segments inserted medially, slender, elongated (but not reaching the tip of neuropodia). Distinct ventral ctenidia observed from chaetiger 13.
Notochaetae numerous of varying length, all finely spinous on one side, some slightly thicker than others. Neurochaetae very distinct; all of the same type, stout, compound, with blades of varying lengths; blades flattened, with widely spaced serration on one side, the other side undulating; distally with blunt, rounded tips.
Remarks. Vouchers lack elytra, therefore their generic assignment cannot be confirmed. Species is characterised by very distinct neurochaetae, which distinguish this species from other Sigalionidae reported here from Falkland Islands as well as from those known from wider region. Given very small size of the specimen we cannot exclude it is a juvenile form. At present we assign these to morphospecies Sigalionidae sp. 2.

Diagnosis. Both vouchers incomplete, the better preserved voucher (T1FB) 16 mm long, 2 mm wide (including parapodia) for 53 segments. Pharynx not extended. All elytra missing.
Prostomium slightly wider than long, with stout cylindrical ceratophore of median antenna bearing small lateral auricles, style missing; lateral antennae rather short, with distinct ceratophores and ovoid styles. Tentacular parapodium with single aciculum and bundles of extremely long, slender capillary chaetae; tentacular cirri with distinct cirrophores; styles long, tapering, and subequal with dorsal tentacular cirri about 2/3 the length of ventral ones. Eyes absent. Palps long, extending to about segment 15, slender, tapering.
Segment 2 with inflated elytrophores. Segment with pair of short bulbous cirrophores; styles missing. Single digitiform branchia and cuplike ctenidia (3 per parapodium, widely spaced) present from about segment 4, well developed from segment 5. Parapodia distinctly biramous. Notopodia only slightly smaller than neuropodia, long, cylindrical, with circlets of stylodes dorsoposteriorly and terminally, stylodes smooth. Neuropodia long, cylindrical, postchaetal lobe with smooth stylodes. Ventral cirri of 2nd segment inserted basally on neuropodium, longer than in subsequent segments (almost reaching tip of neuropodium); on other segments inserted medially, short, subulate, tapered. Ventral ctenidia not observed in 53 chaetigers.
Notochaetae numerous of 3 types: 1. short, thin capillaries; 2. Short to long slender, finely spinous chaetae; 3. long, more robust, chaetae with wider blade, coarsely serrated on one side. Neurochaetae all spinigers, with smooth stems, blades with alternating spines on both side, distally tapering into long slender tips; blades variable in length. 
Original remarks (see also updated remarks). Voucher specimens lack elytra, therefore their generic assignment cannot be confirmed with certainty. But combination of  median antenna with auricles, presence of branchiae and spinigerous neurochaetae suggest it may belong to genus Neoleanira Pettibone, 1970. Neoleanira magellanica (McIntosh, 1885) is a species known from the region (type locality: Tierra del Fuego), but Falkland Islands' specimens are small and not all characters can be established with certainty. At present we assign these to morphospecies Sigalionidae sp. 1.
Updated remarks. Following the intial examination on which description above is based, a better specimens (large, with elytra intact) became avalable. It was confirmed that elytra is transluscent to milky, with entire smooth margin and surface and clavate ventral ctenidia are present from mid body onwards. Falkland Islands specimens agree well with Neoleanira magellanica (McIntosh, 1885) and are therefore re-assigned to this species.

Voucher. VINSON WEST: station 1MFA and  38MFB.
Diagnosis. Voucher incomplete; medium sized species; body 20mm long for 60 chaetigers. Mid- body segments distinctly triannulate. Conical prostomium consisting of about 15 indistinct rings; terminal ring with four appendages. Proboscis with two types of papillae, both with subapical tufts of cilia: 1. numerous elongated, digitiform papillae with brown pigmentation, but without obvious rides (using light microscopy); 2. Less numerous shorter and broader, ovoid papillae with lighter brown pigmentation and with faint “finger-print” like pattern, composed of 3-4 wide rings. Terminal part of proboscis with four hook-shaped jaws arranged in a cross and accessory ailerons with slightly arched base (sensu Böggemann, 2002).
First two pairs of parapodia uniramous, following parapodia biramous. Two triangular to digitiform prechaetal lobes and one shorter, broad, distally rounded, somewhat truncated postchaetal lobe. Dorsal cirri oval to globular, positioned on body wall far above parapodial base. Ventral cirri slender triangular to digitiform, shorter than postchaetal lobes. Branchiae not observed (absent?).  Noto- and neuropodia each with a single acicula. Notochaetae slender, straight or weakly recurved capillary with serration one side. Neurochaetae compound spinigers with blades of different lengths, with serration one side. Pygidium uknown.

Remarks. Commonly reported Glycera kerguelensis McIntosh, 1885 considered synonym of Glycera capitata by Böggemann (2002) has been shown cryptic diversity, with three clades revealed in molecular analysis of Schüller (2011). However Falkland Island specimens do not belong to G. kerguelensis as they possess ailerons with slightly arched base not triangular as defined by Böggemann (2002). In revision of Glyceridae carried out by Böggemann (2002) only G. oxycephala Ehlers, 1887 has similar ailerons, but can be distinguished by having both types of proboscidial papillae with distinct finger-print like pattern with several narrow rings. Falkland Island specimens likely represent a new species and should be formally described. Until such time we assign it morphospecies Glycera sp. 1.

Voucher.  LOLIGO: station 14FA.

Diagnosis. Voucher specimen complete with 16 chaetigers, measuring 5mm long and 0.4mm wide.
Body slender, cylindrical without obvious segmentation except for segments 1–4, which form an oval unit distinct from the rest of body. Epithelium smooth, shiny to iridescent, translucent, single tiny visible papilla can be observed laterally on most segments.  
Prostomium retracted surrounded by one achaetous peristomial ring.  Parapodia biramous, not well developed throughout, best developed and present as lateral transverse welts in segments 1–4, inconspicuous in middle and posterior segments. Chaetae on chaetigers 1-4 of two types – spines and capillaries; elongated pale to yellowish, fairly straight, distally blunt sigmoid spines numbering 2 per fascicle, each with accompanying capillary. Chaetigers 5 to 16 with 1 fine slender capillary and 1 blunt-tipped spine; spines shorter than those on chaetiger 1-4 (tips often broken) and extending beyond end of body.  Anus terminal, usually withdrawn within bilobed last segment. Boundary between distal part of last segment and pygidium indistinct, with midventral cleft.

Remarks. With 16 segments, last segment with spines extending beyond end of body and segments 1–4 of holotype without bidentate modified chaetae, the specimens agrees with Laubieriopsis  brevis. Good summary of the taxonomic problems of this species following problematic description by Hartman (1967) was given by Petersen (2000). It is possible that more than one species exist within what Petersen considered Laubieriopsis brevis complex (see Petersen, 2000 for details).

Voucher.  NIMROD: N1FA.
Diagnosis.  Small-sized, slender species, represented by two complete specimens about 10mm long and 0.5mm wide for 18 thoracic and about 30 abdominal chaetigers; body tapering posteriorly; chaetiger 1-10 short, getting progressively longer from chaetiger 11; then segments increasingly shorter and crowded towards pygidium.
	Prostomium compact; tentacular membrane surrounding the mouth as an enlarged convoluted lobe buccal tentacles missing. Expanded oblong to rectangular structure (=“lower lip” sensu Hutchings and Peart 2000) below tentacular membrane. Eyespots absent.

	Lateral lappets on chaetigers 1–5, anterior margins separated from body wall; a swollen glandular area particularly pronounced in chaetiger 1. Nephridial papillae or nephridial pores not observed (using light microscopy).

	Branchiae arising as a single structure from segments 3–4, consisting of a single mid-dorsal stalked structure made up of 4 lobes; lobes free of each other; anterior pair larger, the posterior pair shorter than anterior pair; lamellae of branchial lobes loose (=not compacted).

Eighteen pairs of notopodia (segments 3–20), compact, rectangular; notopodia of segment 3 (=1st pair of notopodia) much smaller than on subsequent segments; notopodia of segments 4-7 (2nd – 5th pair) appear slightly smaller than those on subsequent segments. All notochaetae simple, narrowly limbate capillaries.
Neuropodia present from chaetiger 6 (segment 8). Thoracic neuropodia as sessile pads; abdominal neuropodia as erect pinnules. Neuropodial uncini in single rows throughout. First thoracic neuropodia (chaetiger 6) with 4-5, sharply bent, geniculate acicular hooks with acute, slightly upward turned tips. Second and all subsequent thoracic neuropodia with about 6 uncini per torus; uncini long handled denticulate hooks with main fang large and surmounted by a crest of smaller denticles. About 30 abdominal uncinigers. Abdominal uncinigers with about 10 avicular uncini per torus, each uncinus with 3–4 teeth above main fang surmounted by number of smaller teeth. Pygidium terminally with 4 very small lobes.
Remarks.  These specimens are similar to Terebellides sp. 2 also recorded from Falkland Island in this study, but are smaller and more slender and their branchial lobes are free. The other species with free lobes recorded form Falkland Islands here, Terebellides sp. 1 differs in body shape (with robust abdomen), lappets on 4 not 5 chaetigers and presence of papillae on some chaetigers (see also comments under entry Terebellides sp. 1).

	Prostomium compact; tentacular membrane surrounding the mouth as an enlarged convoluted lobe, buccal tentacles missing. Expanded oblong to rectangular structure (=“lower lip” sensu Hutchings and Peart 2000) below tentacular membrane. Eyespots absent.

	Lateral lappets on chaetigers 1–5, anterior margins separated from body wall; a swollen glandular area particularly pronounced in chaetiger 1; chaetigers 6 and 7 without lateral lappets, but still somewhat laterally thickened. Nephridial papillae or nephridial pores not observed (using light microscopy).

	Branchiae arising as a single structure from segments 3–4, consisting of a single mid-dorsal stalked structure made up of at least 3 lobes (lobes are completely missing in voucher 1MFA; 3 lobes can be observed in voucher T9FB); pair of anterior lobes large and fused together for more than half of their length; the third lobe positioned ventrally, much smaller, completely free from the anterior pair.

	Eighteen pairs of notopodia (segments 3–20), compact, rectangular; notopodia of segment 3 (=1st pair of notopodia) much smaller than on subsequent segments; notopodia of segments 4-7 (2nd – 5th pair) appear slightly smaller than those on subsequent segments. Notochaetae of 1st pair of notopodia similar in length and thickness to notochaetae of subsequent notopodia but less numerous. All notochaetae simple, narrowly limbate capillaries.

Voucher T4FB: First thoracic neuropodia (chaetiger 6) with few (mostly broken off), sharply bent,  geniculate acicular hooks with acute tips. Second and all subsequent thoracic neuropodia with about 10 uncini per torus; uncini long handled denticulate hooks with main fang large and surmounted by a crest of smaller denticles. Abdominal uncini uknown; abdomen missing.
	Voucher 1MFA: First thoracic neuropodia (chaetiger 6) with 10, sharply bent, geniculate acicular hooks with acute, slightly upward turned tips. Second and all subsequent thoracic neuropodia with about uncini per torus; uncini long handled denticulate hooks with main fang large and surmounted by a crest of smaller denticles. About 25 abodminal uncinigers. Abdominal uncinigers with about 35 avicular uncini per torus, each uncinus with 3–4 teeth above main fang surmounted by number of smaller teeth. Pygidium damaged.
Remarks.  Currently, only three valid species in genus Terebellides are known from the area T. kerguelensis,  T. longicaudatus and T. bisetosa.  Recent revisionary work (Parapar and Moreira, 2008) concluded that T. minutus Hessle, 1917 (type locality: Straits of Magellan - Tierra del Fuego) and T. antarcticus Hessle, 1917 (type locality: Graham Land, Southern Ocean) are synonyms of T. kerguelensis  (McIntosh, 1885).  Terebellides kerguelensis (McIntosh, 1885) was redescribed by Parapar and Moreira (2008) and is characterized by the presence of an anterior branchial extension (5th lobe), lateral lappets in five anterior thoracic chaetigers, segmental organs in chaetigers 1, 4 and 5, and first thoracic acicular neurochaetae sharply bent with pointed tips.Terebellides longicaudatus is characterized by the presence of wide lateral lappets in chaetigers 1 and 2 (segments 3 and 4), first thoracic notopodium which is greatly reduced and large thoracic uncinigerous tori provided with many (45 to 80) uncini and numerous abdominal chaetigers. Terebellides bisetosa  Hartmann-Schröder, 1965 known from Chile can be distinguished by having  2 types of notochaetae. Falkland Islands specimens (1st notopodium smaller, with strongly bent and acutely tipped spines, with about 10 uncini per thorus, lobes on chaetigers 1- 5) are therefore most similar to T. kerguelensis. However the number, size and fusion of branchial lobes cannot be assessed with confidence as these are often damaged in Falkland Island material. Only one specimen had branchial lobes attached and only 3 lobes were observed with unpaired 3rd lobe free and much smaller than anterior pair of branchial lobes. This branchial arrangement is not consistent with T. kerguelensis, but it is not clear if the small lobe/s are missing/regenerating or if this is a true branchial form. Segmental organs in chaetigers 1, 4 and 5 present in T. kerguelensis were not confirmed in Falkland Islands specimens (under light microscopy). It is possible that Falkland specimens represent a new species, but better preserved material will be necessary to establish this. The specimens are assigned here to morphospecies Terebellides sp. 2.

	Prostomium compact; tentacular membrane surrounding the mouth as an enlarged convoluted lobe, buccal tentacles missing. Expanded oblong to rectangular structure (=“lower lip” sensu Hutchings and Peart 2000) below tentacular membrane. Eyespots absent. Lateral lappets on chaetigers 1–4 only slightly enlarged. Small spherical papillae observed dorsally to notopodia of chaetiger 2-4 and 8-10 (visible when specimen Shirla-stained), not confirmed on other segments.

	Branchiae arising as a single structure from segments 3–4, consisting of a single mid-dorsal stalked structure made up of at 4 lobes, which are mostly free of each other;  anterior pair larger, posterior pair about ½ the length of anterior one; lamellae of each branchial lobe loose (=not compact). Eighteen pairs of notopodia (segments 3–20); first 4 pairs of notopodia slightly smaller than those on subsequent segments. All notochaetae simple, narrowly-limbate capillaries.

	Neuropodia present from chaetiger 6 (segment 8). Thoracic neuropodia as sessile pads; abdominal neuropodia as erect pinnules. First thoracic neuropodia (chaetiger 6) with about 5, sharply bent, geniculate acicular hooks with acute tips (completely broken off in voucher N10FB). Second and all subsequent thoracic neuropodia with up to 6 (in voucher N11FA) or 9 (in voucher N10FB) uncini per torus; uncini long-handled, denticulate hooks with main fang surmounted by a crest of smaller denticles.

Voucher. VINSON WEST: station 1MFA and station 3MFB.
Diagnosis.  Voucher 1MFA (too damaged for meaningful description, although extended proboscis clearly observed). Voucher 3MFB small, slender specimen 3mm, slender, incomplete (only 15 chaetigers longs = thoracic segments only, abdomen missing entirely); colour in alcohol pale yellow, no pigmentation. Eye absent. Anterior structures typical for the genus with prostomium inconspicuous lobe; tentacular membrane projecting anteriorly when fully expanded; upper lip projecting anteriorly, with pair of expanded peristomial lateral lobes forming 3-lobed structure; lower lip expanded, forming conical, longitudinally ridged, proboscis. Buccal tentacles short.
Branchiae missing (scars observed); 2 pairs, on segments 2–3; inserted laterally with posterior pair inserted more laterally than anterior pair, notochaetae and uncini begin on the same segment (=segment 6), thoracic uncini all acicular, of the same type on all thoracic segments. All notopodia of similar size. All notochaetae of similar size and structure, simple, smooth-tipped, narrowly limbate capillaries. All thoracic uncini long-handled hooks with large distal fang surmounted by crest of many denticles; uncini arranged in single rows throughout thorax. Abdomen and pygidium missing.
Remarks. The presence of conical ridged proboscis, thoracic long-handled uncini and 15 thoracic chaetigers assign Falkland Island specimens to genus Artacamella Hartman, 1955. While one specimen is badly damaged and the other is incomplete (abdomen is entirely missing), the comparison with only 4 known species of Artacamella suggest, that these represent a new species (see comparative table below). However better preserved material will be necessary in order to formally describe this species, which is here assigned to morphospecies Artacamella sp. 1. At the same time, this is a first record of genus Artacamella for the FI region, but also its first record from deeper waters as known species so far had only shallow water distribution (see table below). Artacamella can be easily confused with genus Trichobranchus Malmgren, 1866 when proboscis retracted (see Hutchings and Peart, 2000; Muir  2011).

Voucher: VINSON WEST: station 5MFA.
Diagnosis.  A medium-sized species, body elongate, arenicoliform, expanded in anterior half then tapering to narrow abdominal region; voucher specimen incomplete with 26 chaetigers, 15mm long and 1.8mm wide at its widest. Colour in alcohol light pink. Body segments bi- or triannulate; annulations formed of large squared cells; body surface relatively smooth, the annulation faint. Pygidium missing.
Prostomium with well-developed narrow, elongated processes or horns, pointed anterolaterally; posterior margin of prostomium visible dorsally; eyes absent. Peristomium achaetous, not concealing posterior margin of prostomium, consisting of single ring complete dorsally; ventrally, both upper and lower lip of mouth composed of around 10 small lobes.
Branchiae absent. Parapodia biramous, reduced, inconspicuous anterior in chaetigers becoming large and well developed in middle and posterior chaetigers. Dorsal and ventral cirri present; small, conical; prominent from chaetiger 16. Interramal papillae small, in anterior chaetigers, becoming larger in middle and posterior parapodia.
All chaetigers with noto- and neuropodial fascicles of slender capillaries; in anterior region arranged into 2 rows, with chaetae of posterior row longest; capillaries of middle and posterior chaetigers arranged in 1 row. Lyrate chaetae present from chaetiger 2; tine very long, unequal, both tapering to very slender filamentous tip.
Remarks. The combination of the following characters – arenicoliform body shape, T-shaped prostomium, presence of dorsal and ventral cirri in posterior segments, absence of spines and absence of branchiae make this species consistent with genus Pseudoscalibregma (see Blake, 1981).
This genus is well represented in the region, with four species known: Pseudoscalibregma bransfieldium (Hartman, 1967); Pseudoscalibregma usarpium Blake, 1981; Pseudoscalibregma papilia Schüller, 2008 and Pseudoscalibregma palmeri Blake, 2015. Falkland Island specimen differs from these and likely represents a news species (see comparative table below).

Asclerocheilus sp. 1
Voucher: SEA LION: station 19MFA.
Diagnosis.  A small-sized species, body elongate, arenicoliform, expanded in anterior half then tapering in abdominal region; voucher specimen incomplete with 27 chaetigers, fragment  5mm long and 0.5mm wide at its widest. Colour in alcohol tanned. Body segments triannulate; annulations formed of small squared cells; annulation distinct. Pygidium missing.
Prostomium small, with prominent rounded anterolateral horns giving it overall heart-shaped appearance; posterior margin of prostomium visible dorsally; eyes absent. Peristomium achaetous, not concealing posterior margin of prostomium, consisting of single ring complete dorsally.
Branchiae absent. Parapodia biramous, reduced, inconspicuous throughout. Dorsal and ventral cirri not developed.
All chaetigers with noto- and neuropodial fascicles of slender capillaries. Chaetiger 1 and 2 with a row of about 10 large, heavy, slightly curved spines, with long filamentous tips. Lyrate chaetae present from chaetiger 2; tines unequal, the longer tine with long slender filamentous tip with distinct subdistal kink.
Remarks. The combination of the following characters – arenicoliform body shape, shape of prostomium, presence of large spines, absence of branchiae and absence of dorsal and ventral cirri make this specimen consistent with genus Asclerocheilus (see Blake, 1981). This genus is represented in the region by only two known species Asclerocheilus capensis Day, 1963 and A. ashworthi Blake, 1981. Falkland Island specimen differs from this species in having distinct rounded prostomial lobes. Such lobes are also present in South African species A. capensis, but Falkland specimen differs in having a heart-shaped prostomium (posteriorly narrower than anteriorly) and lyrate chaetae possess a distinct subdistal kink of the longer tine. Falkland Islands specimen likely represents a new species.

Spiochaetopterus sp. 1
Voucher. LOLIGO: station 3FA and INFLEXIBLE: station 3MFB.
Note: The morphological description of chaetopterids is structured in 3 different body regions following Bhaud (1998): anterior (region A), mid-body (region B) and posterior (region C) (e.g.  A4 = chaetiger 4 in region A, B1= chaetiger 1 in region B).
Diagnosis. Small-sized species, specimen with well preserved region A, but damaged region B and C (specimens incomplete), annoculate species with the following count of chaetigers: 9A, 2B and at least 5C (specimens incomplete); measuring 4mm long and 0.3mm wide for 16 chaetigers. Eyes absent. Chaetiger A4 with a single large modified spine, spine rhomboid (?) in distal view, amber coloured. Long and short lanceolate chaetae present in region A. Red/brown band ventrally on A6 and very distinct white band on A7. Structure of region B and C not clearly observed due to damage of the specimen. Tube unbranched, smooth (no articulations) and translucent.
Remarks. Two species previously reported from the region are  Spiochaetopterus patagonicus Kinberg, 1866, (no description available at the time of writing) and S. costarum (see Hartmann-Schroder, 1991), which differs from FI specimen in having much larger number of mid-body (region B) segments (29 reported by Hartman-Shroder, 1991) and articulated tube.  Bhaud (1998) eastablished  two groups of Spiochaetopterus, based on comparison of five species of the genus Spiochaetopterus: S. typicus, S. bergensis, S. costarum, S. oculatus, and S. solitarius. Group A, with boreal biogeographic affinity, consisting of S. typicus and S. bergensis. Representatives of group A have a middle region of two segments, modified setae of segment A4 are distally rhomboid and the tubes are without articulations. Group B, with temperate biogeographic affinity, consisting of S. costarum, S. solitarius and S. oculatus. Representatives of group B have a middle region of many, always more than 2 segments; modified setae of A4 are distally cordate, and the tubes are with articulations. Falkland Island specimens clearly belongs to group A, which species have boreal distribution. It is therefore likely that Falkland Islands specimens represent a new species, but better preserved material will be necessary to compare and diagnose this species. For now, we suggest morphospecies name Spiochaetopterus sp. 1.

Vouchers. VINSON WEST: station 1MFA and INFLEXIBLE: station 2MFA.
Note: The morphological description of chaetopterids is structured in 3 different body regions following Bhaud (1998): anterior (region A), mid-body (region B) and posterior (region C) (e.g.  A4 = chaegier 4 in region A, B1= chaetiger 1 in region B) .
Diagnosis. Small sized species, all specimens incomplete, measuring 5mm long and 0.75-1mm wide for 20 chaetigers. Body regions with the following number of chaetigers:  9A, 2B and at least 9C (specimen incomplete) with C1-C4 inflated. Eyes absent. Chaetiger A1 with short dorsal, short, wide, “lobes”, far apart, situated lateral to the palps. Chaetiger A4 with about 6 stout modified spines in a single row, decreasing in size ventrally; each spine amber coloured; cup shaped (distally expanded), with several (about 8) teeth on both lateral edges. Region A also with lanceolate chaetae.
Glandular ventral shield as a white band on ventral side of A4. Region B with two chaetigers; B notopodia foliaceous, bilobed; B neuropodia each with single band of uncini. Region C with notopodia, elongated, slender, with two long slender, subdistally lanceolate protruding chaetae; C neuropodia bilobed, with uncini. Mid to posterior C region and pygidium missing. Tube not observed.

Remarks. Based on comparative table of the known Phyllochaetopterus species (see Nishi and Rouse, 2007), the Falkland Island specimens belong to group C: species with several (6 or more) spines in chaetiger A4, 9 chaetigers in region A and only 2 chaetigers in region B.  Currently, there are four other species in this group, all from tropical regions: P. aciculigerus Crossland, 1904 from Maldives, P. herdmani (Hornell in Willey, 1905) from Sri Lanka,  P. verrilli Treadwell, 1943 from Hawaii (P. verrilli is considered a synonym of  P. brevitentaculata from Palmyra Atoll, Pacific Ocean). Given the differences in distribution, Falkland Island specimens likely represent a new species, but comparison with type material will be needed to confirm this.  Falkland Island specimens also differ from the only known species from the region Phyllochaetopterus monroi Hartman, 1967 (type locality Strait of Magellan), which belongs to group A (Nishi and Rouse, 2007) as it possesses 9 chaetigers in region A, 2 chaetigers in region B, but only 1 large spine in chaetiger A4. Falkland Island specimens likely represent a new species, but better preserved material may be needed to fully diagnose this species, until such time it is assigned here to morphospecies Phyllochaetopterus sp. 1.

Two species of Chaetopteridae were collected from Falkland Islands, one belongs to genus  Phyllochaetopterus Grube, 1863 and the other to Spiochaetopterus M Sars, 1856. Both species are likely new to science, suggesting that diversity of this group is greater than two known species reported from the wider region so far Chaetopterus variopedatus (Renier, 1804); Spiochaetopterus patagonicus Kinberg, 1866, S. costarum Hartman-Schroder, 1991 and Phyllochaetopterus monroi Hartman, 1967).  Further, the Chaetopterus variopedatus was originally described from the Mediterranean Sea and it is possible that Southern Ocean specimens belong to other as yet undescribed species. The morphological description of chaetopterids is structured in 3 different body regions following Bhaud (1998): anterior (region A), mid-body (region B) and posterior (region C) (e.g.  A4 = chaetiger 4 in region A, B1= chaetiger 1 in region B).

Chaetigers 1-6 with notochaetae only in both rami; notochaetae capillaries, unilimbate with narrow wings, arranged in two rows of shorter and longer notochaetae.  Abdomen from segment 12 (=chaetiger 11). Both rami with multidentate hooded hooks with relatively slender shaft, series of very small teeth (no main fang apparent), with truncated hood. The rest of abdomen unknown. Pygidium unknown.

Remarks. The combination of characters such as 6 chaetigers with notochaetae only (hooks only present from chaetiger 7) and 12 thoracic segments is consistent with genus Neomediomastus Hartman, 1969. Similar genus Barantolla Southern, 1921 has only 11 thoracic segments. Currently, only two species in the genus Neomediomastus are known: N glabrus (Hartman, 1960) described from Southern California and N. leptus Green, 2002 from Thailand. It is likely that Falkland Islands specimens represent a new species, but better preserved specimens will be necessary to fully diagnose this species. Care should be taken not to confuse these with Notomastus, which has a similar body shape and appearance, but has 11 chaetigers with notochaetae only.

Voucher: TOROA: station T5FB.
Diagnosis.  A medium sized species, body elongate, arenicoliform, expanded in anterior half then tapering to narrow abdominal region; voucher specimen incomplete, 9mm long and 1mm wide at its widest part for 22 chaetigers. Colour light yellow, without orange cast (common in other Scalibregma species); without pigmentation; upon staining, Shirla stain retained ventrally to neuropodia of chaetiger 4 as a patch of pink to reddish dots; similar staining retained in dorsal and ventral cirri of narrow abdominal region.
Body surface with the annulation formed by rows of quadrate cells, these moderately developed, rather faint; cells rectangular and very narrow (much longer than wide); segments tri- to quadriannulate. Ventral midline from chaetiger 2 with group of four large epidermal pads per segment in anterior segments merging into a single pad in middle and posterior segments, forming ridge line within mid-ventral groove; mid-ventral groove and ridge line continuing posteriorly.
Prostomium anteriorly somewhat dome shaped with distinct lateral processes or horns; posterior margin of prostomium visible dorsally; eyes absent. Peristomium achaetous, not concealing posterior margin of prostomium; without distinct segmentation, integument best described as wrinkled, particularly ventrally. Mouth with a row of about 10 narrow lobes forming upper lip, lower lip at level of chaetiger 1, integument wrinkled without obvious lobes .
Arborescent (=dendritically) branched branchiae present on chaetigers 2‒5 posterior to notochaetae. Parapodia biramous, reduced, inconspicuous anteriorly becoming larger and more conspicuous in middle and posterior chaetigers. Dorsal and ventral cirri develop from about chaetiger 11; dorsal cirri round to oval, somewhat inflated, ventral cirri similar; without pigmentation, with yellowish glands present (these turn pink to reddish upon staining with Shirla-stain). Interramal papillae small, in anterior chaetigers, becoming larger by mid body.
All chaetigers with noto- and neuropodial fascicles of slender capillaries; in anterior region arranged into 2 rows, with chaetae of posterior row longest; capillaries of middle and posterior chaetigers arranged in 1‒2 rows.  Chaetiger 1 with additional anterior row of very short, slender chaetae, at least 6 observed in the voucher specimen; these include pointed aristate spinous chaetae, some subdistally slightly enlarged; few appear to be furcate, tips likely broken off; further clarifications with the help of SEM may be needed. Lyrate chaetae present from chaetiger 2; each lyrate chaetae with distinctly unequal tines with the longer tine tapering to very slender filamentous tip. Pygidium uknown.
Remarks. The cosmopolitan status of Scalibregma inflatum (Ashworth, 1902) from Northern Europe  has been questioned and upon careful examination, similar, but distinct species were recently discovered (e.g. Mackie, 1991; Blake, 2000; Baken et al., 2014). Upon revision of Southern Ocean material, a new species Scalibragma australis has been described by Blake (2015). Falkland Islands collection also revealed a diversity of Scalibregma species, with at least 3 species new to science present. Scalibregma sp. 2 differs from the known species as well as from Scalibregma sp. 1 and Scalibregma sp. 3. These differences are summarised in table below, with the conspicuous shape of prostomium being an easy to observe character. Additional observation with the help of SEM will be necessary to fully diagnose this species.

Scalibregma sp. 1
Voucher: SEA LION: station 1MFC
Diagnosis.  A medium sized species, body elongate, arenicoliform, expanded in anterior half then tapering to narrow abdominal region; voucher specimen 22mm long (expanded anterior part 7mm long) and 3mm wide at its widest. Colour in alcohol dark yellow with orange caste; black dots (=glands) forming a row across dorsum of chaetigers 4 and 5; similar isolated pigmented glands ventrally near neuropodia of chaetigers 4 and 5; similar black glands in dorsal and ventral cirri of posterior parapodia. Body surface covered with annulated rings; annulations formed of separate quadrate cells.
Prostomium T-shaped, with lateral processes or horns well developed, pointed anterolaterally; posterior margin of prostomium visible dorsally; eyes absent. Peristomium achaetous, not concealing posterior margin of prostomium, consisting of single ring complete dorsally, split into three rings ventrally forming the upper lip of the mouth and together with annulated rows from chaetiger 1 forming the lower lip of the mouth. Ventrally, row of about 5 lobes on upper lip of mouth and posteriorly about 10 lobes arranged along lower lip of mouth at level of chaetiger 1.
Dorsally, chaetigers 1 and 2 triannulate, other anterior chaetigers quadriannulate, then becoming pentannulate and quadriannulate in posterior chaetigers. Ventral midline from chaetiger 2 with group of four large epidermal pads per segment in anterior segments merging into a single pad in middle and posterior segments, forming ridge line within mid-ventral groove; mid-ventral groove and ridge line continuing posteriorly.
Arborescent (=dendritically) branched branchiae present on chaetigers 2‒5 posterior to notochaetae. Parapodia biramous, reduced, inconspicuous anteriorly becoming larger and more conspicuous in middle and posterior chaetigers. Dorsal and ventral cirri develop from midbody, about chaetiger 10; dorsal cirri round to oval, somewhat inflated, ventral cirri similar. Dorsal and ventral cirrus with darkly pigmented glands, most prominent from chaetiger 15 until end of the body (fragment). Interramal papillae small, in anterior chaetigers, becoming larger in middle and posterior parapodia.
All chaetigers with noto- and neuropodial fascicles of slender capillaries; in anterior region arranged into 2‒3 rows, with chaetae of posterior row longest; capillaries of middle and posterior chaetigers arranged in 1‒2 rows. Additional inconspicuous short, slender, pointed aristate spinous setae on chaetiger 1 as reported by Blake (2015) could not be confirmed here. Lyrate chaetae present; their first occurrence (=chaetiger) not established; each lyrate chaeta with distinctly unequal tines (about 2:1 length ratio), with the longer tine tapering to very slender filamentous tip. Pygidium not clearly observed, damaged.
Remarks. The cosmopolitan status of Scalibregma inflatum (Ashworth, 1902) from Northern Europe has been questioned and upon careful examination, similar, but distinct species were recently discovered (e.g. Mackie, 1991; Blake, 2000; Baken et al., 2014). Upon revision of Southern ocean material, a new species Scalibragma australis has been described by Blake (2015). Falkland Islands collection also revealed a diversity of Scalibregma, with at least 3 species new to science present. Falkland Islands specimens differ from S. australis and as well as other congeners by a combination of characters (see comparative table below). Additional observation with the help of SEM will be necessary to fully diagnose this species.

Scalibregmatidae sp. 1
Voucher: VINSON WEST: station 1MFA.
Diagnosis.  A small sized species, body elongate, anterior part slightly expanded, gradually tapering posteriorly; voucher specimen incomplete, with 14 chaetigers, 2mm long and 0.5mm wide. Colour light yellow, without pigmentation; without staining pattern (using Shirla-stain).
Body surface with the annulation formed by rows of quadrate cells, these moderately developed, more or less quadrate; segments tri- to quadriannulate. Ventral midline from chaetiger 2 with epidermal pads present until the end of fragment. Prostomium with very elongated processes or horns; positioned anteriorly giving the prostomium V-shaped appearance; posterior margin of prostomium visible dorsally; eyes absent. Proboscis partially everted, concealing the nature of peristomium and anteriormost segments ventrally.
Arborescent (=dendritically) branched branchiae present on chaetigers 2‒5 posterior to notochaetae. Parapodia biramous, reduced, inconspicuous in 14 chaetigers. Dorsal and ventral cirri not developed on 14 chaetigers present; uknown in posterior chaetigers.
All chaetigers with noto- and neuropodial fascicles of slender capillaries; in anterior region arranged into 2 rows, with chaetae of posterior row longest; capillaries of middle and posterior chaetigers arranged in 1‒2 rows. Lyrate chaetae present from chaetiger 2; each lyrate chaeta with unequal tynes with the longer tyne tapering to very slender filamentous tip; bristles on inner margins very short. Abdomen and pygidium uknown.
Remarks. The lack of midposterior and posterior segments due to incompleteness of the specimens prevents conclusive generic assignment of this specimen (the development of dorsal and ventral cirri in those segments is an important taxonomic character). Given the small size of the specimen, we cannot exclude that it may be juvenile. The distinct form of its prostomium distinguishes this specimen from other scalibregmatid material collected form Falkland Islands in this study.

Voucher. TOROA: station T4FB.
Diagnosis. Small, complete specimen; body inflated, compact (=”grub-shaped”), thickest at middle and tapering to both ends; 3 mm long and 1 mm for 17 chaetigers. Body whitish to pale yellow. Integument rugose; ventrally segments crowded; dorsally each segment with 3 rows of reticulated pattern, composed of rectangularish (much wider than long) cells. Prostomium sharply conical, much longer than wide; eyes absent. All chaetigers biramous; without obvious parapodia. First chaetiger with chaetal fascicles shifted dorsally; chaetal  fascicles well separated in all chaetigers. Branchiae absent. Two achaetous, pre-anal segments. Anal cylinder abrupt after last parapodial segment, very small and short, composed terminally of 4-5 short, rounded lobes.
Remarks. This is a small, featureless specimen that does not appear to fit any known species in this genus as it is very small in size, possesses low number of segments and lacks characters such as branchiae, distinct parapodial lobe or obvious nephridiophores. The lack of branchiae align this species with abranchiate species previously assigned to genus Kesun Chamberlin, 1919, which has been synonymised with Travisia by Dauvin and Bellan (1994). Falkland Island specimen is here assigned to morphospecies Travisia sp. 1.

Taxonomic status of this group is in flux.  Travisiidae were originally created as a subfamily of Opheliidae by Hartmann-Schröder, 1971, but subsequently shown to be a sister group to Scalibregmatidae from molecular studies (Paul et al., 2010). The notes in WORMS database suggest that recently this group has been raised in rank to a separate family by Blake and Maciolek (2016: online, unpublished nomenclaturally), which we follow here. Genus Travisia Johnston, 1840 is well represented in waters from the region (particularly from deeper waters) by 10 species: Travisia glandulosa McIntosh, 1879,  Travisia kerguelensis McIntosh, 1885, Travisia chiloensis Kükenthal, 1887, Travisia olens Ehlers, 1897, Travisia nigrocincta Ehlers, 1913, Travisia profundi Chamberlin, 1919, Travisia antarctica Hartman, 1967, Travisia amadoi Elías, Bremec, Lana and Orensanz, 2003, Travisia monroi Maciolek & Blake, 2006, Travisia palmeri Maciolek and Blake, 2006, Travisia tincta Maciolek and Blake, 2006.
Only one species has been found so far in material from Falkland Islands collected here. These specimens are assigned to morphsopecies Travisia sp. 1 (see separate entry for details).

"Terebellidae Johnston, 1846"," Terebellidae Johnston, 1846

The classification followed here is reflecting current status in WoRMS database (see link: http://marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=982), which can be summarized as follow: only subfamilies Terebellinae, Thelepodinae, and Polycirrinae are recognised with Amphitritinae now disused in favour of Terebellinae, Thelepinae emended to Thelepodinae and Artacaminae is not currently used, as Artacama is included in Terebellinae. We do not follow recent re-organisation as proposed by Nogueira, Fitzhugh & Hutchings (2013).

Terebellidae have confused taxonomic history with the on-going debate (Nogueira, Fitzhugh & Hutchings, 2013). This is another group from the region in urgent need of revision and update of taxonomic literature. The species overview is here organised by subfamily. Briefly the subfamilies as recognised here can be identified as follows (modified from Jirkov and Leontovich, 2013; see also other references below for terminology, characters and alternative classifications):

Terebellinae: upper lip usually small; branchiae present or absent, if present of various shapes, usually branched; thoracic uncini arranged in double rows in posterior thorax.

Thelepodinae: upper lip usually small; branchiae always present, as simple filaments and never branched; thoracic uncini arranged in single row.

Polycirrinae: upper lip elongated; branchiae absent; thoracic uncini present or absent, if present always arranged in a single row.

"Terebellinae sp. 1"," Terebellinae sp. 1
Voucher. SEA LION: station 19MFA (2specimens).
Diagnosis. Two specimens, large and robust, but in bad condition, incomplete. Voucher specimen 17mm long and 3mm wide for about 16 thoracic chaetigers and about 5 abdominal uncinigers (posteriorly incomplete); body light yellow in alcohol, without pigmentation. Eyes absent. Segmental lobes not particularly enlarged, but present; segment 1 and 2 similar, low ventrally, with moderately enlarged ventrolaterally lobes; segment 3 also low ventrally, with small lateral lobes.
Branchiae present; 3 pairs on segment 1-3, these are likely damaged as only stumps observed.
Thorax with 16 chaetigers. Notochaetae from segment 3; relatively numerous, arranged in two rows, long and short, both narrowly bilimbate throughout the length of the shaft. Thoracic uncini present from chaetiger 2 (=segment 4), first 6 uncinigers with uncini in a single row, arranged in double (alternating) row from unciniger 7, until the end of the fragment. Thoracic uncini avicular, with rostrate tooth (see images for details). Abdomen unknown. Pygidium unknown.
Remarks. Generic assignment of these specimens is problematic. Presence of uncini arranged in double row, presence of branchiae and form uncini is consistent with subfamily Terebellinae. However as branchiae are likely damaged (only single stumps are present), it is difficult to assign generic ID. The specimens are therefore assigned to morphospecies Terebellinae sp. 1 until better preserved material becomes available.

Body segments wide, not crowded; body robust, cylindrical. Peristomium with reddish horizontal band form by many small eye spots. Segmental lobes absent. Branchiae present; 3 pairs; each composed of few simple, smooth filaments (1st pair with 5; 2nd with 4, 3rd with 3-4). Abdomen unknown. Pygidium unknown.
Notochaetae present from 1st branchigerous segment. Notochaetae long and short, very thinly bilimbate capillaries, with very long, slender tips. Uncini first clearly observed from segment 4; always in single rows; each uncinus avicular with one larger and one smaller tooth above the main fang in lateral view; basal prow moderately developed with elongate sub-terminal button separated from prow by distinct notch.  
Remarks. As total number of thoracic chaetigers (=species level character) cannot be established due to incompleteness of the material, this specimens is assigned to morphospecies Streblosoma sp. 1 until better specimens become available.

Voucher. LOLIGO: station L14FB.
Diagnosis.  Voucher specimen reasonably well preserved if incomplete; 6.5mm long, 0.8 mm wide for 13 thoracic chaetigers and 6 abdominal uncinigers (posteriorly incomplete); dark yellow to light orange in colour. Dorsum anteriorly tessellated; anterior end with 4-5 inflated, rounded structures (probably damage?). Venter anteriorly with mid-ventral groove and discrete ventro-lateral pads; pads discrete to about chaetiger 6 (=segment 8). Upper lip comprising single (medial) lobe only, margin of lobe convoluted.  Pygidium not observed.
Thorax with 13 chaetigers. Notochaetae composed of long and short tapering capillaries. Uncini beginning on 1st abdominal segment (=segment without notochaetae, with uncini only). Neuropodial tori erect rectangular pinnules, similar along body. Uncini with short neck and straight to convex base, with one large and one small tooth above main fang in lateral view; subrostral process present as low, rounded protuberance.
Remarks. Polycirrus sp. 1 agrees in some respects with P. hesslei Monro, 1930 described from Falkland Islands. They share 13 thoracic segments with notochaetae and uncini present from 1st abdominal unciniger (=uncini absent on segments with notochaetae). Monro’s type is housed at NHM London and was also checked (see also re-description by Glasby and Hutchings, 2013), however the much larger size of the holotype compared to Falklands Island specimens complicates a meaningful comparison. However, the upper lip of Falklands Island specimen appears to be comprised of single lobe with convoluted rather than trefoiled as in P. hesslei and dorsum of anterior end is tessellated rather than smooth. This is probably a new species, but further work is needed to provide a full description of this species. Genus Polycirrus has been recently revised by Glasby and Hutchings (2013).

Diagnosis. Voucher incomplete specimen in good state of preservation, 9mm long and 1mm wide with 17 thoracic chaetigers and at least 14 abdominal uncinigers (posteriorly incomplete). Body cylindrical, thorax somewhat inflated, with dorsal “hump” on segment 5-7 and abdomen tapering; segments 1-7 crowded, then getting longer form segment 8.
Prostomium triblobed; eyes absent.
Segment 1 dorsally incomplete, well developed ventrally without prominent lobes. Segment 2 also low, but more developed then segment 1, best developed ventrally, with enlarged, rounded ventrolateral lobes, dorsally as low ridge without any prominent lobes (attachment of 1st pair of branchial pair). Segments 3 similar to segment 2 with enlarged lobes placed laterally; dorsally segment 3 forming a low rim without any lobes (attachment of 2nd branchial pair). Segments 4 thickened laterally otherwise similar to subsequent segments. Genital papillae on segments 6–7, located posterior to notopodia and dorsally aligned with them.
Two pairs of branchiae on segments 2–3; first pair present, with left brachia much smaller than right branchia, both positioned close together; arborescent with “Christmas tree-like” shape; second branchial pair missing/regenerating with stem present on right side; inserted ventrally compared to first pair, separated by a wide gap.
Pygidium unknown.
Seventeen pairs of notopodia, starting from segment 4 and extending until segment 20 (the last thoracic segment/unciniger); first pair of notopodia about same size as following pairs, all notopodia vertically aligned. Notochaetae narrowly bi-limbate, distally smooth, arranged in two rows.
Neuropodia starting from chaetiger 2 (segment 5); in thorax as low rectangular ridges slightly raised from surface of body until segment on which notopodia terminate; in abdomen as short rectangular pinnules situated laterally on body, internal neuropodial shafts present. In thorax uncini arranged in a single row in chaetigers 2–7 (segments 5 – 10) and in intercalated double rows from chaetiger 8 (segment 11) until the end of thorax. Thoracic uncini with elongated handle originating from heel, with sharp rostral tooth situated at mid-length between base of main fang and tip of prow, distally rounded prow and crest with 3–4 rows of secondary teeth. Abdominal uncini from chaetiger 18 (= segment 21), short-handled with rostral tooth situated at mid-length between base of main fang and tip of prow, distally rounded prow and crest with up to 4 rows of secondary teeth.
Remarks. There are several species found in the Falkland Islands material, which are likely new to science and are here assigned morphospecies name only. Pista is a large genus, reported worldwide and comparisons with these are not provided here as further work by specialists will be needed. This genus is characterized by the presence of lobes on anterior segments, long-handled uncini occurring for variable number of segments on the region with biramous parapodia, and 17 pairs of notopodia with broadly winged notochaetae, starting from segment 4. Santos et al. (2010) also proposed that morphology of lobes in this group, especially with regard to the shape of lobes on segment 1, is important for distinguishing species. Those characters were used here to separate different morphospecies of Pista (see comparative table).

Prostomium triblobed, with peristomium forming wide, dorsally incomplete collar; eyes absent.
Segment 1 dorsally high, forming a high single lobe (on which pair of branchia is attached), ventrally also well developed, with large rounded lateral lobes. Segment 2 extremely small, only slightly visible laterally. Segments 3 similar to segment 1 with rounded lateral lobes aligned with those of segment 1; dorsally segment 3 forming a high rim with two low rounded dorsal lobes. Segments 4 and 5 thickened laterally otherwise similar to subsequent segments.
One pair of branchiae present on segment 2; left hand side branchia detached (scar observed), right hand side branchiae present; branchia plumose with the ratio of stem to crown length about 2:1.
Pygidium unknown.
Seventeen pairs of notopodia, starting from segment 4 and extending until segment 20 (the last thoracic segment/unciniger); first pair of notopodia about same size as following pairs, notopodia of chaetigers 1–3 (segments 4–6) inserted progressively more laterally, than vertically aligned. Notochaetae widely bi-limbate, distally smooth, arranged in two rows.
Neuropodia starting from chaetiger 2 (segment 5); in thorax as low rectangular ridges slightly raised from surface of body until segment on which notopodia terminate; in abdomen as short rectangular pinnules situated laterally on body. In thorax uncini arranged in a single row in chaetigers 2–7 (segments 5 – 10) and in intercalated double rows from chaetiger 8 (= segment 11) until the end of thorax; thoracic uncini with elongated handle originating from heel, with rounded rostral tooth situated at mid-length between base of main fang and tip of prow, distally rounded prow and crest with 3–4 rows of secondary teeth. Abdominal uncini from chaetiger 18 (= segment 21), short-handled with rostral tooth situated at mid-length between base of main fang and tip of prow, distally rounded prow and crest with up to 4 rows of secondary teeth.
Remarks. There are several species found in the Falkland Islands material, which are likely new to science and are here assigned morphospecies name only. Pista is a large genus, reported worldwide and comparisons with these are not provided here as further work by specialists will be needed. This genus is characterized by the presence of lobes on anterior segments, long-handled uncini occurring for variable number of segments on the region with biramous parapodia, and 17 pairs of notopodia with broadly winged notochaetae, starting from segment 4. Santos et al. (2010) also proposed that morphology of lobes in this group, especially with regard to the shape of lobes on segment 1, is important for distinguishing species. Those characters were used here to separate different morphospecies of Pista (see comparative table).

Pista is a large genus, reported worldwide and comparisons with these are not provided here as further work by specialists will be needed on this group. This genus is characterized by the presence of lobes on anterior segments, which are now considered of taxonomic importance (Santos et al., 2011) as well as long-handled uncini occurring for variable number of segments on the region with biramous parapodia, 17 pairs of notopodia with broadly winged notochaetae, starting from segment 4 and presence of 1-3 pairs of plumose or branching branchiae (Nogueira et al., 2011). Those characters were used here to separate different morphospecies of Pista (see comparative table).

Lysilla sp. 1
Voucher. HERO: station 1MFA.
Diagnosis: Voucher a single specimen, small, nearly severed into two pieces, with posterior part stretched and damaged; about 7mm long, thorax 0.9mm wide (at widest, “swollen” part). Upper lip projected forward as a large, convoluted lobe. Dorsum and venter anteriorly tessellated to rugose. Nephridial papillae not observed (even upon staining with Shirla stain). Six pairs of very slender, elongated, but distally enlarged notopodia present (presumably on segments 3-8).  Notochaetae few, all very short, smooth, thin. The rest of body damaged.
Remarks. The only known species from the region Lysilla macintoshi Gravier, 1907 has been described from shallow depths (25-40m) holotype was 14mm long, 3mm wide, brown-yellow with 6 segments with notochaetae, large genital papillae on segments 6-8 and very long, subdistally spatulate notochaetae (see image below). Of the 14 described species of Lysilla, only two other species have notopodia terminating on segment 10 or before. Lysilla loveni Malmgren, 1866, originally described from Sweden with 6-8 pairs of notopodia extending until segments 8–10, with winged notochaetae in both rows. Lysilla longilinea Nogueira, Hutchings and Carrerette, 2015 from Lizard Island, Australia has only five pairs of notopodia (on segments 3–7) and its thorax is not swollen. Although Falkland Island specimen is not in the best condition, the comparison here suggests it represents a new species. However a well preserved specimen is needed to provide a formal description and to corroborate the preliminary conclusion reached here.

Leaena? sp. 2
Voucher. VINSON WEST: station 1MFA.
Diagnosis. Voucher specimen very small and slender, complete, about 4mm long and 0.4mm wide for about 33 chaetigers. Body anteriorly somewhat dorsoventrally flattened. Segmental lobes absent. Branchiae absent. Eyes absent. Abdomen with about 22 uncinigers. Pygidium rounded lobe.
Eleven thoracic chaetigers. Notochaetae of 2 types – long, broadly bi-limbate and short lanceolate. Thoracic uncini present from chaetiger 2, first 6 uncinigers with uncini in a single row, from unciniger 7 arranged in double (alternating) row, until the end of the fragment.
Remarks. Generic assignment of these specimens is somewhat problematic as taxonomy of abranchiate terebellids lacks consistent characters. The combination of the following characters: absence of branchiae, presence of uncini from chaetiger 2 and presence of lanceolate notochaetae shows affinities with genus Leaena Malmgren, 1866. Genus Leaena appears to be well represented in the region. Number of thoracic chaetigers varies from 10-17 in different species. Further work would be necessary to establish if Falkland Island species represents a new species and name Leaena sp. 2 is assigned here provisionally.

At least 16 thoracic chaetigers with notochaetae. Notochaetae of 2 types – long, slender, narrowly bi-limbate and short lanceolate (those are missing on the last 3 thoracic chaetigers). Thoracic uncini present from chaetiger 2, first 6 uncinigers with uncini in a single row, from unciniger 7 arranged in double (alternating) row, until the end of the fragment.
Remarks. Generic assignment of these specimens is somewhat problematic as taxonomy of abranchiate terebellids lacks consistent characters. The combination of the following characters: absence of branchiae, presence of uncini from chaetiger 2 and presence of lanceolate notochaetae shows affinities with genus Leaena Malmgren, 1866. Abranchiate genus Pseudoproclea Hutchings and Glasby, 1990 with only one known species from Australia also similar, but lanceolate chaetae are not present. Genus Leaena appears to be well represented in the region. Number of thoracic chaetigers varies from 10-17 in those species. As specimens collected from Falkland Islands are incomplete and posterior part of thorax is damaged (stretched) it is difficult to establish the number of thoracic chaetiger with certainty and compare characters derived from the abdomen. The specimens are therefore assigned to morphospecies Leaena sp. 1 until better preserved material becomes available.

"Hauchiella sp. 1"," Polycirrinae Malmgren, 1867

Hauchiella sp. 1
Voucher. VINSON WEST: station 1MFB.
Diagnosis. Voucher specimen is a single, incomplete and damaged specimen; relatively robust, fragment about 7mm long and about 1.8mm wide; anterior part of the body is more robust, then tapering; number of segments not established. All tentacles missing. Large, convoluted upper lip is much wider than long. Thoracic segments strongly annulated, narrow and tessellated.  Genital papillae not confirmed (damage to the tissue covers a large part of thorax).
Remarks. Given the complete lack of chaetae, there are very few characters available to distinguish between species of Hauchiella. For a long time, only the type species of the genus Hauchiella tribullata (McIntosh, 1869) described from St Magnus Bay, Shetlands, Scotland, from 165 m was known and reported widely, including reports from the Southern Ocean. The holotype of this species was reported by Nogueira et al. (2015) to be large and robust (about 20mm long, up to 2mm wide), with very few buccal tentacles remaining (all uniformly cylindrical), with a large, convoluted upper lip of width greater than length, and large, rounded nephridial papillae on segments 6–8. Hauchiella renilla Hutchings and Glasby, 1986 was described as a second species in this genus more than 100 year later and distinguished from H. tribullata by its smaller size and absence of genital papillae. Only very recently a third species Hauchiella tentaculata Nogueira, Hutchings and Carrerette, 2015 was added and distinguished form the other two species by modified long tentacles and inconspicuous or absent nephridia  (=not visible through the body wall). It is, therefore, likely that Falkland Island specimen represent a new species, but well preserved material will be necessary to formally describe this species.

Voucher. SEA LION: station 40MFB.
Diagnosis. Voucher specimen is a large, robust, complete specimen; about 85mm long and 5mm wide, with 16 thoracic chaetigers with notochaetae and numerous (>200 abdominal uncinigers).
Distal part of prostomium forming conspicuous shelf-like process from which buccal tentacles originate (tentacles mostly missing); basal part of prostomium without eyespots. Peristomium forming lips and continuing laterally from mouth for short extension; upper lip short, hood-like, lower lip narrow.
Segment 1 short, most developed ventrally and ventrolaterally, forming protruding ventral lobe below lower lip. Segments 2–4 with anterior margins thickened, but without lobes. Branchiae present; two pairs on segments 2-3 (left branchia on segment 2 missing); second pair aligned slightly laterally to first pair; first pair about twice as large as the second ones (both shorter than body width); both dichotomously branching with short ramifications; each with short and thick main stem. Nephridial papillae present segments 3 and 6-8; inserted laterally to branchial stem on segment 3 and anteriorly to base of notopodia and aligned to them on segments 6-8.
Notopodia from segment 4, present on 16 segments. Notochaetae arranged in two rows with those in anterior row shorter; notochaetae smooth, subdistally with bi-limbate inflation, inflation expanded basally; distally extending into slender tip. Neuropodia beginning on chaetiger 2 (segment 5), as low rectangular ridges slightly raised from the surface of the body throughout, without internal supporting rods. Uncini short handled, with conspicuous dorsal button, short triangular heel and prow distally pointed and downwardly directed; uncini in double rows, from thoracic unciniger 7 (segment 11) until posterior body (including many abdominal segments, but about posteriormost 1/3 of the body with uncini in single rows again).
Pygidium slightly damaged, not clearly observed. Tube: fine, smooth, muddy; patches of thin sand encrustation on the body observed.
Remarks.  Falkland Island specimen agrees well with genus Amphitritides in having two pairs of small, dichotomously branching branchiae, much shorter than body width, neuropodia as low ridges along whole body, with uncini arranged in double rows from the 7th uncinigerous segment until posterior segments, where in single rows again. Similar genera Neoleprea Hessle, 1917 and Tyira Hutchings, 1997 can be distinguished in that notopodia begin on segment 2 in Tyira, segment 3 in Neoleprea while it is segment 4 in Amphitritides (Nogueira and Hutchings, 2007). The species in genus Amphitritides can be distinguished from each other mainly by the number of pairs of notopodia, morphology of notochaetae and uncini, segments with nephridial papillae and their position. Combination of these characters suggests that Falkland Island specimen represent a new species and should be formally described. The comparison of Falkland Island specimen and six known species of Amphitritides is provided in the table below (see also Nogueira and Hutchings, 2007 for more details).

Anterior pseudo-compound hooks tridentate with truncated hoods; palmate chaetae flat; subacicular hooks bidentate, starting on chaetigers 12–15.
Remarks. The body of this species has an iridescent sheen and in fresh material there is a pigment spot at the base of the anterior chaetigers. Orensanz (1990) notes that the ventral cirri of this species are cirriform over the anterior 4 to 5 chaetigers.

Voucher specimen. VINSON WEST: station 1MFB.
Diagnosis. Small worm, 5 mm fragment with 21 chaetigers. Chaetiger 1 enlarged and facing forwards. Five pairs of antennae with the median one longest, ceratostyles with three obvious rings and then an elongated plain area before the junction with the ceratophore in the three median antennae. Peristomial cirri present situated laterally as long as or slightly longer than perostomium-prostomium.
Branchiae present from chaetiger 9, formed as simple branch of the dorsal cirrus.  
Chaetae formed of elongated curved hooks in chaetiger 1, very slightly bidentate with the send hook no more than a slight raised knob; in subsequent chaetigers pseudo-compound bidentate hooks present, with limbate and palmate chaetae, the latter flat to slightly curved and with 9 teeth along the free edge. Subacicular chaetae present from chaetiger 6, obviously bidentate, with short blunt hood.
Remarks. This species resembles the description and diagrams give by Orensanz (1990), but there are differences. The head is not small and narrow compared to following segments, the form of the parapodia of chaetiger 1 is less robust, the form of the hooks on chaetiger 1 are finer with less obvious bidentate endings and the start position of the subacicular hooks is on chaetiger 6 not chaetiger 4 as described by Orensanz (1990). The main difficulty in providing an authoritative identification is because of the great disparity in size between the type specimens of Anchinothria pycnobranchata and the FI specimens, which are much smaller. Some of the differences outlined may be related to size and require a range of specimen sizes for study before a definitive identification can be given.

Diagnosis.  Voucher small sand slender, but complete specimen; 15mm long and 0.4mm wide for 17 chaetigers and 3 pre-anal rings; chaetigers 1-7 relatively short (about twice as long as wide), from chaetiger 8 segments very long (about 4 times as long as wide), with the two posteriormost chaetigers short again;  first pre-anal ring short (resembling preceding chaetiger), the second and third anal rings very short, crowded. Preserved specimen pale yellow in colour.              
Prostomium with well-developed cephalic plaque; cephalic rim very low, without notches (with the exception of two shallow “dips” near mid-anterior peak), palpode not developed; low rising cephalic keel present throughout the length of cephalic plaque, bordered by straight, slightly divergent nuchal organs; no ocelli.
First chaetiger with both noto- and neurochaetae. Neuropodia of chaetigers 1 -3 with single rotsrate hook (dentition of these uncini well-developed); in subsequent chaetigers up to 7 rostrate uncini arranged in a single row; with several thin fibrils (barbells) underneath the main fang; with manubrial constriction on its shaft.
Anal plaque well developed, symmetrical, bordered by about 10 extremely short, sub-triangular cirri of equal size and one very long, thin mid-ventral cirrus. Conical anus protruding from anal plaque. Tube not observed.
Remarks. This species has been ascribed to genus Axiothella based on the combination of the following characters: well developed cephalic and anal plaques, symmetrical anal plaque border by cirri of (mostly) equal size, neurochaetae of chaetigers 1-3 as a single rostrate hooks, reduced in number compared to subsequent segment and anus protruding from anal plaque.  Revision of Maldanidae from the region is needed and currently we ascribe Falkland Islands’ specimens to Axiothella sp. 1

Chaetae observed from chaetiger 4; only about 7 per fascicle; all compound spinigers with slender blades, tapering into thin tips; rostrum of chaetal shaft of two types – tridentate, with similar large teeth and those with single large tooth and 3 pairs of smaller teeth on each side. Pygidium not observed.
Remarks.  The generic placement of this specimen is somewhat problematic as it shows similarities to genus Pterocirrus (mostly due to anterior position of median antenna), but also show similarities to genus Eulalia. This specimen resembles Eulalia microoculata from Northern Europe, which itself shows a combination of characters from both genera. Falkland Island specimen differs in lacking eyes (small eyes are present in E. microoculata), having trapezoid rather than rounded prostomium, bottle-shaped form of some tentacular cirri and while dorsal cirri are also flattened and vey elongated, they do not appear to have paddle-shaped form with expanded tips in E. microoculata.

Voucher. SEA LION: station 19MFB.
Diagnosis.  Two voucher specimens incomplete, in bad condition, with all tentacular and dorsal cirri missing, few ventral cirri present; 3-4mm long and 0.3-0.4mm wide for around 27-28 segments; preserved specimens dark yellow to orange in colour; ventral cirri with small blotches of brown pigment.
Prostomium almost rounded; eyes absent; with 2 pairs of prostomial appendages: pair of antenna and pair of cirriform palps, of similar form, long (reaching almost to segment 1) and cirriform; median antenna not observed (see remarks). Proboscis not observed. Tentacular cirri missing, but scars clearly observed confirming presence of 4 pairs in 1+2+1 arrangement. Segment 1 not reduced dorsally.
Dorsal cirri all missing. Ventral cirri mostly missing, those present ovate, with small blotches of brown pigment. Chaetigerous lobes, assymetrical, with slightly (but distinctly) longer digiform in upper part; with about 10 chaetae. Chaetae present from segment 4; all compound spinigers, with unidentate, distinctly striated, serrated blades with thin tips; the rostrum with series of small, fine serrations. Pygidium not observed.
Remarks.  The specimens are in imperfect condition, but clearly represent a distinct species from other phyllodocid material encountered in Falkland Islands collection. Generic identification is based on asymmetrical chaetigerous lobes, which is a hallmark of genus Sige Malmgren, 1865, but also occurs in closely related genus Pterocirrus Claparède, 1868 (see Pleijel, 1990; 1993). The two genera are further distinguished based on the insertion of median antenna – medially in Sige, but anteriorly in Pterocirrus as well as the form of proboscis, which was not observed in Falkland Island material. The median antenna was not observed in either of the Falkland specimens and even upon staining of the specimens, the presence of its scar is difficult to observe, possibly placed anteriorly. Better specimens will be needed to fully diagnose this species and confirm the generic identification.

Voucher. SEA LION: station 44MFB.
Diagnosis.  Voucher is a medium sized species in good condition, but posteriormost chaetigers and pygidium missing; 31mm long and about 1mm wide (including parapodia) for 109 segments; colour pale yellow; with small, indistinct reddish patches medially, near the posterior border of prostomium.                                                                                                                                                    
Prostomium trapezoid, broadest posteriorly (about twice as broad as the anterior margin), only slightly longer than wide (compared to widest posterior part); anteriorly somewhat truncated; with continuous median dorsal groove; eyes, not observed (possibly small, subcutaneous eyes present); nuchal papillae not observed. Two pairs of prostomial appendages of similar form, short and cirriform: pair of antennae and slightly longer pair of palps.                                                                 
Proboscis not observed.                                                                                                                           
Tentacular segments with 2 pairs of cirriform, distally tapering cirri of subequal size, with ventral cirrus slightly longer than dorsal cirrus. Second segment without dorsal cirri; with chaetae; ventral cirri and neuropodia reduced. Subsequent chaetigers with ovoid dorsal cirri with rounded tips; parapodial lobes similar in development, slightly increasing in size towards mid-body in proportion with width, and then slightly decreasing again posteriorly; ventral cirri more elongated than dorsal cirri, with more pronounced, but still rounded tip. Chaetae compound spinigers, with slender unidentate blade, rostrum with a pair of large equal sized teeth. Posteriormost chaetiger and pygidium missing.            
Remarks. This specimen is in a good condition, although pygidium is missing and proboscis is not everted (as this is the only example of this species collected, proboscis was not dissected) and those characters are needed to confirm the generic identity (see Wilson, 1988 for details on genera, Eteone, Hypereteone and Mysta). Of those genera only two species are known from the region. Eteone sculpta Ehlers, 1897 and  Eteone aurantiaca Schmarda, 1861 (Eteone spathocephala Ehlers, 1897  with type locality Falkland Islands is considered a junior synonym of this species). Based on images provided by Ehlers (1897), the Falkland Island specimens agree well with E. spathocephala (now accepted as E. aurantiaca) in shape of prostomium, although anal cirri are missing and cannot be compared. The anal cirri in specimen of Ehlers (1897) are very long, which suggest that this species should belong to genus Hypereteone Bergström, 1914 (see Wilson, 1988) and so likely does the specimen collected from the Falkland Islands here. Until the complete specimen is available, we assign this species to  Eteone cf. aurantiaca.

Diagnosis.  Small and slender species, voucher specimen slightly desiccated; likely complete, but antennae, tentacular and anal cirri missing; 8mm long and 0.35mm wide; preserved specimen yellow in colour, with dorsal cirri with light brown pigments and ventral cirri with dark red pigments.
Prostomium almost rounded, with a pair of black eyes positioned in the middle of prostomium; prostomial appendages missing. Proboscis not observed. Tentacular cirri missing. Dorsal cirri lacking on segment 3, otherwise present; rounded to ovoid, somewhat inflated, lightly pigmented, relatively small (not exceeding the tip of neuropodia). Ventral cirri similar to dorsal cirri, but smaller, slightly wider than long; with dark red pigment. Chaetigerous lobes, narrow, conical, of similar length, with one acicular and about 9 chaetae. Chaetae compound spinigers, with slender unidentate blades with thin tips; the rostrum without any pronounced teeth, only series of small, fine serrations. Pygidium not observed.
Remarks.  One species in genus Mystides is known from the region, M. notialis  Ehlers, 1913 (type locality: Kaiser Wilhelm II Coast). Falkland Island specimen is similar in shape of prostomium, shape of dorsal and ventral cirri and presence and position of eyes.  Given that important diagnostic features such tentacular and anal cirri are missing or not observed (proboscis) in Falkland Islands specimen, we prefer to assign this specimen to morphospecies Mystides cf. notialis until better specimens become available.

Diagnosis.  Very small species; voucher specimen complete; 3mm long and 0.35mm wide (including parapodia) for 30 segments; preserved specimen yellow in colour, only ventral cirri with dark red pigments.
Prostomium subpentagonal, with a pair of large, very faint, red eyes positioned in posterior part of prostomium; with 2 pairs of prostomial appendages, only pair of antennae still attached, bottle shaped, palps missing. Proboscis not observed. Three pairs of tentacular cirri in 1 (on segment 1) + 2 (on segment 2) arrangement (where cirri missing scar observed), cirri bottle-shaped (shape not as pronounced as in antennae), those present of similar lengths.                                                                                                                                                             
Dorsal cirri mostly missing, present in some mid-body segments where rounded to ovoid, somewhat inflated, not pigmented, relatively small (not exceeding the tip of neuropodia). Ventral cirri similar to dorsal cirri, ovoid; with patches of dark red pigment. Neuropodia relatively short, conical, chaetigerous lobes, of similar length; with one acicular and up to about 15 chaetae. Chaetae compound spinigers, with slender unidentate blades with thin tips; the rostrum without any pronounced teeth, only series of small, fine serrations. Pygidium rounded, wide lobe, with very small, round, lateral cirri; no other cirri observed.
Remarks. This specimen also shows affinities with genus Nereiphylla, but only 3 pairs of tentacular cirri were confirmed, which approach bottle-shaped form, dorsal cirri are spherical, inflated and ventral cirri are horizontally inserted, suggesting this specimen belongs to genus Mystides. Shirla-stain revealed a possible presence of scar or small median antenna, near the posterior margin of prostomium. Should presence of median antenna be confirmed in subsequent specimens, then generic affiliation is likely with genus Pseudomystides. One species in genus Mystides is known from the region, M. notialis Ehlers, 1913 (see entry Mystides cf. notialis). Falkland Island specimen differs in position, size and colour of eyes and is therefore assigned to a different morphospecies as Mystides sp. 1.

Prostomium low, much wider than long (widest posteriorly), posterior margin poorly distinguished, anteriorly rounded; with 2 pairs of rudimentary prostomial appeandages (pair of antennae and pair of palps); eyes absent. Nuchal papilla not observed, ligula not observed. Proboscis not observed.                                                                                                          
Segments 1 and 2 dorsally fused, not clearly set of prostomium dorsally. Four pairs of tentacular cirri in 1+2+1 arrangement, with 1st pair missing (scar observed); following pair of cirri with dorsal cirrus twice the length of ventral cirrus, reaching to segment 7; fourth pair similarly long.                                                                                                                                                    
Dorsal cirri foliose, elongated, with symmetrical rounded margin. Ventral cirri similar to dorsal cirri, but smaller. Chaetigerous lobes, narrow, conical, slightly assymetrical, with one acicula and about 8 chaetae per fascicle. Chaetae compound spinigers, with slender unidentate blades with thin tips; rostrum of chaetal shaft asymmetrical, with a main tooth and series of very fine serrations. Pygidium simple, wide, rounded lobe, no cirri observed (assumed missing).
Remarks.  This species has a rather distinct look, due to fusion of first two segments with prostomium. It strongly resembles genus Chaetoparia, but no chaetae were observed on ventrum of segment 4. Similar fusion is also known in genus Paranaitis, which also lack median antenna and possess 4 pairs of tentacular cirri and nuchal papillae and chaetae on segment 3 may be absent, as it is the case in Falkland Island specimen. Although only one specimen was collected, it is in a good condition and complete, although anal cirri are likely missing. Specimen was stained using Shirla-stain in order to determine the presence of median antenna/nuchal papilla/ligula and these were not observed. However, a greater number of specimens would be preferable to check for consistency of these characters, which would suggest a new species in this genus.

Diagnosis.  Voucher is a large, almost complete (pygidium missing) specimen in good condition; 37mm long and 1.8mm wide (including parapodia); some light brown pigmentation present on dorsum of anterior segments, with segment 5 and 6 darkest, segments 7-10 lighter, thereafter pigmentation fading with faint horizontal line per segment present. 
Prostomium anteriorly rounded, about as wide as long; with two pairs of prostomial appendages of similar form, short and cirriform: pair of antennae and pair of palps; with a pair of red, subdermal eyes near the posterior margin; nuchal papilla not observed. Proboscis not observed. Four pairs of tentacular cirri; cirri of segment 1, dorsal and ventral cirri of segment 2, and dorsal cirri of segment 3 cylindrical, with long, tapered ends; cirri of segment 1 reaching segments  4-5. Dorsal cirri of segments 2 and 3 reaching about segment 10. Ventral cirri of segment 2 reaching segment 4-5.                                                    
Parapodia uniramous; europodial lobes long, with both lobes of similar length. Dorsal cirri large, foliose, changing throughout the body in the following fashion: anterior – broad and rounded to ovoid (increasing in size posteriorly); mid body – distally distinctly truncated, acquiring subrectangular form (largest); posterior – decreasing in size, oval to rounded. Ventral cirri of similar throughout, elongated, tapering into pronounced tip; changing in size with those in mid body region largest. Chaetae compound spinigers with very slender blades, tapering into extremely long thing tips; rostrum of chaetal shaft number of fine serrations; anteriorly about 15 per fascicle; in mid-body about 25 per fascicle. Additionally, in midbody chaetigers a single, very thin simple capillary observed in the ventralmost position in the chaetal fascicle. Pygidium not observed.
Additional information. As part of taxonomic standardization exercise, other very similar specimens from Falkland Islands became available for examination. One specimen had an everted proboscis: proximal part with 12 rows (6 on each side) with about 8 papillae per row and single mid dorsal row with 4 papillae, subdistal part of proboscis with large irregular mounds; distally with circlet of ~17 small rounded papillae.
Remarks. Proboscis was not everted in otherwise well preserved voucher, but additional specimens became available for examination and proboscis of one individual was cleraly observed, confirming the presence of the single dorsomedian row of papillae as in P. patagonica (see separate entry with comments on genus Phyllodoce from the region). Distinctly truncated, subrectangular shape of dorsal cirri in median segments was confirmed in voucher specimen, specimens further suggesting similarities to P. patagonica, but also P. truncata (see separate entry with comments on genus Phyllodoce from the region). Unfortunately, the dorsal cirri in specimen with everted proboscis were mostly missing, with most posterior one present around segment 30, where the fully truncated shaped has not been yet developed. Further there is some variation in anteriormost dorsal cirri, which can be rounded, broadly oval to elongated oval (see comparative images). Molecular evidence may be needed to confirm if differences observed here represent different species. For now we suggest to include these under Phyllodoce patagonica complex.

Diagnosis.  Voucher is medium sized, incomplete specimen, 12mm long and about 1mm wide (including parapodia) for 50 chaetigers; colour in alcohol pale pink, no pigmentation except for very small brown patch, on dorsum of the first segment.
Prostomium anteriorly rounded, about as wide as long; with two pairs of prostomial appendages of similar form, short and cirriform: pair of antennae and pair of palps; with pair of red, subdermal eyes in the middle of prostomium; nuchal papilla not observed. Proboscis partially everted, with the proximal part observable; proboscis covered by soft, brown pigmented papillae arranged in 12 (6 on each side) rows and single dorsomedian row of papillae; the number of papillae per row not fully observed (likely 10 or more for paired rows and possibly about 7 per single row); distal part of proboscis not observed.
Four pairs of tentacular cirri; cirri of segment 1, dorsal and ventral cirri of segment 2, and dorsal cirri of segment 3 cylindrical, with long, tapered ends; cirri of segment 1 reaching segments  6-7, with brown spot near their bases; dorsal cirri of segments 2 and 3 reaching about segment 14. Ventral cirri of segment 2 reaching segment 6-7.                                                    
Parapodia uniramous; neuropodial lobes long, with both lobes of similar length. Dorsal cirri large, foliose, mostly missing from the posterior end of the fragments, changing throughout the body in the following fashion: anterior – oval (increasing in size posteriorly); mid body – approaching rhomboid shape; slightly longer wide.
Ventral cirri similar throughout, elongated, widest near the base, then tapering, ending in sharp, slender, elongated tip; changing in size with those in mid body region largest. Chaetae compound spinigers with very slender blades, tapering into extremely long thing tips; rostrum of chaetal shaft number of fine serrations; anteriorly Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. Proboscis was at least partially everted in the voucher specimen, confirming presence of the single dorsomedian row of papillae as in P. patagonica (see separate entry with comments on genus Phyllodoce from the region). However unlike in other Phyllodoce species collected here from Falkland Islands, the dorsal cirri of mid-body segments are not distinctly truncated and subrectangular but somewhat rhomboid (see comparative image). Further, ventral cirri have very sharp, elongated tips and specimen lacks pigmentation (except for very faint small patch on dorsum of segment 1). Due to these easily observable differences, we assign this species to Phyllodoce sp. 1, which likely represent a new species.

Pygidium not clearly observed, damaged.
Additional observations: Voucher VINSON WEST: station 38MFB is very similar to the species above, but it is strongly pigmented, with body dark yellow to orange in colour and both dorsal and ventral cirri with dark red pigments; specimens is very short fragment of 15 segments (1.2mm long; 0.3mm wide), but anterior end is well preserved. Specimen has 4 pairs of tentacular cirri and it is consistent with genus Protomystides. Four pairs of tentacular cirri in 1+2+1 arrangement (cirri of segment 1, dorsal and ventral cirri of segment 2, and dorsal cirri of segment 3), all slender, cylindrical, with long, tapered ends; cirri of segment 1 and ventral cirri of segment 2 shorter than dorsal cirri of segments 2 and cirri of segment 3, which are long reaching to about segment 7. Chaetal blades are broken off. It is not clear currently if the two vouchers represent the same species given the differences in colouration.
Remarks.  Currently, there are no known species in genus Protomystides known form the area. Further work will be necessary to establish if Falkland Islands specimens represent new species, which is for now assigned to morphospecies Protomystides sp. 1. The two colourmorphs may represent different species, but we are currently unable to resolve this problem without greater number of well-preserved specimens and molecular evidence.

At least six species, currently belonging to genus Phyllodoce have been described from the region (see tables below), many of them with confused taxonomic history and imperfect descriptions.
Examination of Phyllodoce species collected from Falkland Islands suggests the presence of at least 4 forms with affinities to P. patagonica based on form of the proboscis with dorsomedian row of papillae and truncated, subrectangular dorsal cirri in mid-body segments and are here treated as P. patagonica complex until molecular evidence becomes available. Additionally, morphospecies Phyllodoce sp. 1. with similar form of proboscis has also been recorded, but it lacks pigmentation, and dorsal cirri of mid body segments are rhomboid rather than truncated (see comparative image of Phyllodoce species).
Notes on Phyllodoce species known from the region as reported in literature.

Species


Notes


P. patagonica


The original description by Kinberg (1866) is incredibly brief, not accompanied by drawings and therefore of very little value, with type material in bad condition (Bergström, 1914).  Reports of P. madeirensis (i.e. Ehlers, 1897, 1913) from the region are likely to belong to P. patagonica. Additional taxonomic information was provided by Bergström (1914).


P. pseudopatagonica


Augener (1922) mainly distinguished this species (type locality: Juan Fernandez) form P. patagonica based on distributional differences, with P. pseudopatagonica confined to warmer waters, while P. patagonica to colder water of Magellanic region. Based on images of Augener (1922) the dorsal cirri are rather elongated, tapering, not subrectangular.


P. longipes


P. longipes was also inadequately described by Kinberg (1866) and description of Phyllodoce cf. longipes was provided by Pleijel (1993), although based on specimens from Norther Europe. Pleijel (1993) reported oval dorsal cirri, while for example image of Day (1963) used by Hartman (1966) shows broadly lanceolate form with short, slender tips. It is clear P. longipes has been misidentified in the past.


P. adarensis


Detailed description with drawings provided by Benham (1927); reported by Hartman (1966)


P. truncata


Subrectangular dorsal cirri of P. truncata described from Peru and Chile by Hartmann-Schröder (1965) are of similar form to P. patagonica (based on information in Hartman, 1966). Hartmann-Schröder (1965) did not provide description of the proboscis, nor did she provide comparison with P. patagonica.

"Sabellidae"," Sabellidae Laterille, 1825
Together with Terebellidae, Sabellidae were the most species rich (and taxonomically challenging!) family collected from Falkland Islands (with S >20). Some genera such as Jasmineira, Euchone and Amphicorina were particularly species rich. Existing descriptions of Sabellidae from the geographical region of interest here are often brief/incomplete and this group would greatly benefit from the revision and re-description of holotypes (where possible) as many characters, particularly those of the branchial crown, have not been discussed by earlier taxonomist. As a result many Sabellidae species were misidentified in the past as some recent provisional work demonstrated, particularly for genus Perkinsiana and related genera (see Knight-Jones, 1983, Giangrande and Gambi, 1997 and Tovar-Hernández et al., 2012 for details). Here we attempt to give a complete description of species collected from Falkland Islands as possible, given constrains of completeness of material and taxonomic expertise. Inevitably, characters derived from the branchial crown were not always possible to determine when the crown was missing. Further, this section of the guide would greatly benefit from the input by sabellid specialists as assignment to some genera is uncertain (denoted by “?”) and interpretation of some characters related to branchial crown can be problematic. Taxonomic key to Sabellidae genera provided by Tovar-Hernández (2010) was used to establish generic identifications. Useful introduction to taxonomic characters of Sabellidae (and Fabriciidae) was provided by Giangrande et al. (2015).

cf. Novafabricia sp. 1
Voucher. Vinson West: Station 2MFA
Diagnosis. Very small, short species; voucher complete specimen with branchial crown; length 1.1mm plus 0.25mm for branchial crown; body width  0.1mm; body cylindrical, narrow, tapered anteriorly and posteriorly; preserved specimens white to pale yellow; body with eight thoracic and three abdominal chaetigers.
Branchial crown with three pairs of radioles; distal ends filamentous, same width as pinnules; ventral filaments absent. Anterior margin of anterior peristomial ring a low ridge dorsally and laterally; ventrally a well-developed tongue-like lobe. Peristomial eyes not observed.
Superior thoracic notosetae elongated, narrowly hooded. Inferior thoracic notosetae and pseudospatulate chaetae not confirmed (due to damage and very small size of specimen); thoracic acicular uncini in a single irregular row, 5 per fascicle. Abdominal uncini, not observed in detail using light microscopy.
Pygidium conical lobe, pygidial eyes no observed.
Remarks. This species is represented by an extremely small, fragile and somewhat damaged specimen therefore not all characters could have been established. The combination of observed characters points to genus Novofabricia because of collar with well-developed ventral lobe, absence of ventral filaments however the degree of fusion of ventral lips with radiole and distribution of pseudospatulate chaetae cannot be established with certainty.
Genus Novafabricia is represented by a single species so far known from the area investigated here. N. chilensis was described from Chile, shallow water. However even though FI specimen is problematic, it is possible to detect some differences to N. chilensis, which has black peristomial and pygidial eyes present in preserved specimens and thoracic acicular uncini are in distinct double rows with 9-14 per fascicle, rather than 5 uncini arranged in a single row as in FI specimens. Another genus reported from deeper Southern Ocean waters is Raficiba, Fitzhugh 2001, represented by Raficiba barryi, which differs from FI specimen by presence of black peristomial and pygidial eyes and more elongate, scoop-like shape of the collar. FI specimen most likely represents another new species in the family Fabriciidae, third reported in this study. However, greater number of well-preserved specimens will be necessary to establish all characters and generic identity with confidence.

"Polychaeta"," INTRODUCTION
The Taxonomic Guide to benthic polychaetes of the Falkland Islands is an extension of the benthic environmental assessment and monitoring programmes (EAMPs) accompanying oil exploration in the region. A large collection of around 25000 polychaete specimens resulted from two benthic surveys carried out in 2011-2012 and processed at the Natural History Museum (NHM) London. Besides the immediate goal of EAMPs, such collections offer a great potential for systematics and biodiversity research, opportunity which is often not realized. The aim of this current project was to make benthic collections from these EAMPs available for further research. Polychaete worms are the first group to be processed. The project has two main goals:

		Taxonomic guide to standardize identification.

		Curation of sample collection at NHM London to facilitate access to these collections.
The two objectives are closely linked. The need for standardized taxonomic guide is immediately linked to EAMPs, which are carried out by a number of Environmental Consultancies (ECs). Simply put, it provides a single source for identification of polychaete, making sure that everyone calls the same species with the same name.
Funding for this work was made available through The South Atlantic Environmental Research Institute (SAERI) and the Natural History Museum, London.
The Falklands Fauna
Marine benthic fauna from the Falklands area has been considered to be part of the Magellanic province, but links were also drawn to the Southern Ocean and sub-Antarctic fauna.  Available taxonomic monographs for these regions (Hartman 1966; 1967; 1978; Hartmann-Schröder 1962; 1956; Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt 1988; 1989; 1990; 1991; 1992) are in need of an update.  Recent taxonomic efforts concentrated on the polychaete family Ampharetidae  (Schüller and  Jirkov, 2013) exemplified the problems summed up in the following statement: “The Southern Ocean and also Patagonian waters represent an interesting geographical region, as many species recorded from these areas were originally described from the Northern hemisphere (compare e.g., Hartman 1966; 1967; 1978; Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt 1988; 1989; 1990; 1991; 1992). These records from Southern waters may possibly be the result of misidentification and give some substance for the discovery of new species from already well-defined genera. During the 20th and early 21st centuries, frequent expeditions were undertaken in the Southern Ocean. In the samples from the ANDEEP I–III expeditions to the deep Weddell Sea (2002, 2005) over 450 ampharetid specimens belonging to over 20 species (Schüller 2008; Schüller et al. 2009) have been found, many of which are undescribed”. We concur that this is also a problem for other polychaete families. Therefore returning to the first objective – the taxonomic guide- is to provide a standardized taxonomic resource, particularly those species that are currently not formally described (“the unknowns”).
The large number of species new to science, outdated taxonomic literature and need for taxonomic revisions as scientific knowledge evolves demonstrate the need for accessibility of collections such as those from Falkland Islands to as many taxonomic experts as possible. Making collections available to the research community is an important part of the curatorial function of institutions such as NHM London, which was the second objective of this project.  The taxonomic guides itself is an identification tool and its aim was not to solve taxonomic problems, which are merely highlighted, stressing the need for future work by taxonomic experts for particular groups.

Clymenura Verrill, 1900
Clymenura sp. 1
Voucher. SEA LION: station 3MFC and (tentatively) TOROA: station T4FA.
Diagnosis. SEA LION Voucher is a medium sized, incomplete specimen; 15mm long and 0.6mm wide for 11 chaetigers long fragment; preserved specimen light pink in colour. Chaetigers 1-6 about 1mm long (longer than wide) and distinctly separated by deep intersegmental grooves; chaetiger 7-8  of similar length but without pronounced segmental furrow; chaetigers 9 – 11 (end of fragment) much longer, fused. Chaetiger 8 with a distinct semi-circular glandular pad on dorsum as typical for this genus, pad is almost as long as the chaetiger 8.                
Prostomium with well-developed cephalic plaque; cephalic rim with lateral (one on each side) and single mid-dorsal notches, anteriorly with shallow dips near mid-anterior peak (not developed into palpode). Nuchal organs wide and straight, slightly diverging anteriorly, about ½ the length of plaque, bordering a very low lying keel-like structure. The posterior half of cephalic plaque with faint horizontal lines (not fully developed into ridges).                                                                                                                                                
Notochaetae capillaries of two types – long, smooth, very narrowly limbate chaetae (about 4 per fascicle) and more numerous (about 8 per fascicle) shorter simple, very thin capillaries. ). In chaetigers 1 -3 single neuropodial rostrate hook present, dentition of these uncini well developed;  from chaetiger 4 about 10 rostrate uncini arranged in irregular single row, uncini with main fang and 4 small teeth, up to 4 thin barbells underneath the main fang; with  manubrial constriction on its shaft. Posterior end and pygidium not observed. Tube not observed.
Additional notes:  As part of taxonomic intercalibration exercise, additional specimen of Clymenura collected from Falkland Islands became available for examination. These possessed pygidial (although fragmented, no complete specimen was observed). The posterior ends of these specimens (otherwise consistent with SEA LION voucher described above) were of following form:  5 pre-pygidial rings (segments without chaetae); anal plaque with few thin cirri, largely differing in length with at least 3 long ones bordered by few shorter ones (three pygidia were available for examination, 3 long cirri were always present, but the number of shorter ones varied); cirri never developed on the dorsal side.
Remarks.  Falkland Island specimens are consistent with genus Clymenura as they possess ventral pad on chaetiger 8; well-developed cephalic plaque and neuropodia of chaetigers 1-3 with a low number (one) of  rostrate uncini. Currently, there are no known species of Clymenura from the region (Leiochone singularis Gravier, 1907 is considered a nomen dubium). Of the known Clymenura species, FI specimen are most similar to C. borealis from Northern Europe and C. lankesteri from Japan which also possess 5 or 5-6 pre-pygidial rings (other species have only 2-3), have cephalic rim with lateral and dorsal notches and reduced number of uncini in first chaetiger as well as reduced dentition in these uncini, the pygidial cirri are all long and thin. Falkland specimens appear to differ in not having ocelli and in possessing few anal cirri of varying length, although it is not clear if some are just missing. Falkland Island specimens likely represent a new species, but currently it is unclear if there are more than species of Clymenura present as no complete specimen has been found so far. For the same reason, it is unclear if the two voucher specimens represent the same species, but based on currently available morphological evidence, the two specimens share characters, mentioned above.

"Maldanidae Malmgren, 1867"," 
Maldanidae is a species rich family in Falkland Islands’ waters. Specimens were often heavily fragmented and incomplete as is typical for maldanids.  Not all species could have been unambiguously assigned to a genus, therefore some were identified to subfamily only. The available taxonomic literature from the region is problematic with regards to this family and in need of an update.

Voucher. ENDEAVOUR: station E4FA.
Diagnosis. Very slender species with very long segment (possibly damaged –stretched?); voucher is the only example collected; assumed incomplete as only 12 chaetigers present; posterior part possibly damaged (uncertain if true pygidium present); 18mm long and 0.3mm wide. Chaetiger very slender and long, chaetiger about 0.5mm long, chaetigers 2 – 4, around 1mm long, subsequent chaetigers  >2mm long.
Prostomium fused to peristomium; cephalic plaque present, strongly arched, rounded anteriorly (not extended into palpode); with very low rim, anteriorly smooth; posteriorly somewhat crenulated; straight, anteriorly diverging nuchal organs in posterior part of prostomium. Eyes or ocelli not observed.
Notochaetae few (3-5? per fascicle), often broken off, at least 3 types observed: rather short spatula chaeta; long, thick, bilimbate chaeta with fine tip and short, thin, capillaries (about 1- 3 per fascicle).
Uncini present from chaetiger 1; all rostrate hooks; increasing in number from 3 in chaetiger 1 to up to 8 in mid-body chaetigers. Each uncinus with main fang and about 6 smaller teeth, without fibrils, but with a small hood below the main fang; long, bent shaft with a pronounced localized swelling (breast) in the middle.
Preanal segments not obvious.  Pygidium (if real rather than damaged), very small, asymmetrical, with numerous, irregular, short, rounded lobes.
Remarks. Generic identity of this incomplete specimen is uncertain and we adopt a conservative approach to identifying it only to a sub-family. Voucher agrees with family Euclymeninae as it has a head with plaque, neurochaetae from chaetiger 1 and reduced in number in first 3 chaetigers. It is not clear if the specimen is complete, the posterior end is most likely damaged/regenerating.

Vouchers. VINSON WEST: station 3MFB and 4MFB.
Diagnosis.  Small and slender species; voucher incomplete; a single anterior fragment with 13 chaetigers, 7mm long and 0.25mm wide; colour is whitish to pale yellow.                                                                          
Prostomium without cephalic plaque, but with high cephalic keel; prostomium narrow, slightly elongated, “hood” shaped; together with peristomium separated from the first chaetiger by a segmental furrow, without dorsal crest.  Chaetigers 1 - 8, long and narrow (about 2-3 times longer than wide); chaetigers 9 – 13 (end of fragments), extremely long (up to 8 times longer than wide). Ventral glandular shields or segmental collars not observed. 
Chaetigers 1-4 with notochaetae only; notochaetae few, narrowly limbate shorter and longer capillaries. Uncini from chaetiger 5, where few (about 5) arranged in a single row, in subsequent chaetigers increasing in number and become arranged in irregular to double rows; from chaetiger 8, more distinctly arranged in 2 semicircular rows on slightly raised fleshy pads, until the end of fragment (=chaetiger 13). The uncini have a large main fang surmounted by about 4 vertical rows of small teeth in frontal view, as 3 smaller teeth above the main fang in lateral view ; breast of uncini with a stout subrostral spine above basal prow; basal prow thick.                                                                                    
Posterior part and pygidium not observed. Tube: specimen from station 4MFB with small remnant of the tube; appear loose, composed of coarse black particles, adorned with few tests of foraminifera.
Remarks.  This is a rather interesting species which belongs to the rather rare, species-poor subfamily Bogueinae Hartman & Fauchald, 1971, although characters derived from posterior part of the body cannot be confirmed. It resembles Rhodine in lacking cephalic plaque and having uncini arranged in double and single rows, with their start from chaetiger 5 (also 4 in Bogueinae). However Bogueinae lack segmental collars and vary in other characters (see Wolf, 1983 for details).  Of the two genera of Bogueinae, Falkland Islands specimens agree with genus Boguea in having uncini from chaetiger 5 rather than 4 as in Boguella. Each genus contains only one species and both were re-described by Wolf (1983). Boguea enigmatica has been described from the southern part of the USA Atlantic coast from shallow waters (2 – 101m). Unfortunately, Falkland Islands specimens are very short, incomplete and not all characters can be compared. They likely represent a new species as only smooth, limbate notochaetae were observed, uncini from anterior part of the body are of different form (see comparative image) and dimensions of body segments differ from B. enigmatica (segments appear of similar length in drawing provided by Wolf, 1983). Complete specimens will be necessary to fully diagnose this species and provide full comparison with B. enigmatica.

Vouchers. VINSON WEST: station 5MFA.
Diagnosis.  Large species; voucher complete; slightly desiccated; 38mm long and 1.2mm wide for 19 chaetigers; colour in alcohol pale yellow; tube partially preserved.
Prostomium fused with peristomium; without cephalic plaque; with high cephalic keel; prostomium narrow, elongated, anteriorly rounded; nuchal slit, deeply curved; separated from the first chaetiger by an indistinct segmental furrow; followed by a further two indistinct annuli. Chaetigers longer than wide, except for posteriormost chaetigers, which are about as long as wide; all segmentation relatively indistinct, with very shallow segmental furrows; chaetigers 1-3 biannulate. Notochaetae of two type, long, thick and smooth bilimbate chateae (about 5 per fascicle in anterior chaetigers) and shorter to long, slender, distally hirstue chaetae (about 10 per fascicle in anterior chaetigers). Uncini from chaetiger 1; in chaetigers 1- 4 as one or two large, stout, blunt, honey-coloured spines; from chaetiger 5 as rostrate hooks; each hook has a large main fang surmounted by 3 smaller teeth; few (about 2) slender fibrilis and small swelling below the main fang, handle long; up to 8 per fascicle in mid-body segments, reduced to 4 in the last chaetiger.
Posterior part (posteriormost chaetigers and pre-anal achaetigerous segments) inflated (damaged, artefact of preservation?) and not clearly segmented, exact numbe of pre-anal segments difficult to establish; abruptly narrowing into short, slender, pygidial cone. Pygidial cone dorsally, with small, overhanging, rounded flap. Tube soft (easy to open); internally as a soft muddy lattice; externally adorned with tightly packed, coarse, medium sized particles, mostly black and white, giving speckled appearance.
Remarks.  This species is represented by a single, but complete specimen in Falkland Islands collection. Only one species in genus Lumbriclymenella (no species in similar genus Lumbriclymene) is known from the region.  Lumbriclymenella robusta Arwidsson, 1911 (type locality: South Georgia, depth 75m; subsequently reported from Falkland Islands by Fauvel, (1916)) agrees in possessing 19 chaetigers. However the following differences were noted from L. robusta (based on images accompanying description of Arwidsson in Hartman (1966): no red pigmentation of anterior end; hooks with swelling below the main fang, with fibrils (however some hooks may lack fibrils); posterior end inflated (this may be artefact of preservation), not distinctly segmented.  Deep-sea species Lumbriclymenella nasuta (Wesenberg-Lund, 1948; type locality Greenland, 2258 m) has been recently re-described by Kongsgrud et al. (2013) and it is also very similar to both L. robusta and Falkland Islands specimens. More specimens from Falkland Islands need to be collected and compared with type specimens of other Lumbriclymenella species to establish if this represent a new species.

Pre-anal achaetigerous segment/s likely present, but not clearly visible. Anal plaque likely not fully developed yet (larval character) or alternatively missing.
Remarks. Recently, Darbyshire (2013) described a new species Micromaldane shackletoni  from Falkland Islands, intertidal depths and provided comparative table to all know species in this genus.
However Falkland Island specimen collected here, from slope depths (~1000m) is not the same species as M. shackletoni as it clearly has spatulate, lancet notochaeta, rather than narrow ones. Only two of the known species of Micromaldane possess spatulate chaetae – the type species of the genus M. ornithochaeta Mesnil, 1897 (type locality: France, know considered cosmopolitan, including the records of Fauvel (1916) from the Southern Ocean) and M. jonesi Achari, 1968 known from India.                                                                                                                                                                  
Given the extremely small size, low number of chaetigers and incomplete segmentation, it is likely that this specimen represents the advanced larval stage (see discussion in Darbyshire, 2013) and it is not assigned to any species until more specimens become available.

Voucher.  SEALION: station 80MFC.
Diagnosis. Complete specimen; small to medium sized, slender species; 20mm long and 0.4mm wide for 22 chaetigers and two pre-anal achaetous segments; colour in alcohol light pink, with redish brown pigments anteriorly on ventrum of chaetigers 1-5 (most pronounced on chaetigers 2 and 3). Chaetigers 1 – 6 short (about twice as long as wide), chaetigers 7 – 12 long; from around chaetiger 13 getting progressively shorter again, with the last 2 chaetigers and 2 pre-anal segments very short.                                                                                                 
Prostomium fused to peristomium; without cephalic plaque; rounded, forming hood-like projection overhanging mouth with greatly arched cephalic keel; nuchal grooves as parallel slightly pigmented slits.
Notopodia of chaetigers 1–22 with fascicles of long and narrow capillary chaetae of two types; long, very thin and sparsely hirsute along most of its shaft (about 2 per fascicle) and smooth, stout, narrowly limbate chaetae (about 5 per fascicle). Additionally, from chaetiger 5 a single, very long, thin and often spiralled chaeta present; its posterior distribution uncertain. Neuropodia of chaetigers 1–3 with a single large, stout, dark yellow, pointed acicular spine. Posterior to chaetiger 4, neuropodia with a row of rostrate uncini. Each uncinus with a main fang and 4 small teeth; with long, and up to 4 thin fibrils (barbels) below main fang; number of rostrate uncini variable, with up to 6 observed.                             
Two very short, equal, pre-anal achaetous segments present.  Anal funnel symmetrical, cup-shaped,  with relatively shallow-rim bearing 17 short, sub-triangular, equal-sized anal cirri.  Anus terminal, located in center of funnel.
Remarks. Comparative table of all known Nichomache species was recently given by De Assiz et al. (2007). So far two Nichomache species are known from the region of interest here.  N. lumbricalis , is an assumed cosmopolitan species, but it seems  doubtful that Southern Ocean records belong to the Northern European species. The drawing and description in Hartman (1966) shows a smooth anal plaque, without any cirri while comparative table of all Nichomache species provided by de Assis et al. (2007) states anal plaque as cup shaped bordered by 17-31 asymmetrical cirri. Another report of N. lumbricalis by Hartman (1967) includes a record (denoted by “?”) from Falklands Is. in 646-845m. This record is accompanied by very brief description of posterior end only, which states that:” …(anal) plaque surrounded by a circlet of 17-21 fringes; all are about equally short. The last setigerous segment is followed by two segments without chaetae”.  This is consistent with the form of anal plaque in FI specimens found here. Further work would be necessary to establish if this really represents a new species different form Northern European Nichomache cf. lumbricalis, therefore the FI specimens are assigned to  Nichomache lumbricalis (Fabricius, 1780) sensu Hartman, 1967.
N. monroi was described from Bismarck Strait in 93-315m by Hartman (1967) but it differs from the current species because it possesses about 30 papillae bordering the anal plaque preceded by 2 achaetous segments and up to 2 spines in first three neuropodia.

Vouchers. VINSON WEST: station 3MFB.
Diagnosis.  Small and slender species; voucher incomplete; a single anterior fragment with 13 chaetigers, 7 mm long and 0.25mm wide; colour is whitish to pale yellow. Prostomium without cephalic plaque, but with high cephalic keel; prostomium  narrow, slightly elongated, “hood” shaped; together with peristomium  separated from the first chaetiger by a segmental furrow, without dorsal crest.  Chaetigers 1 - 8, long and narrow (about 2-3 times longer than wide); chaetigers 9 – 13 (end of fragments), extremely long (up to 8 times longer than wide). Ventral glandular shields or segmental collars not observed.  Chaetigers 1-4  with notochaetae only; notochaetae few, narrowly limbate shorter and longer capillaries. Uncini from chaetiger 5, where few (about 5) arranged in a single row, subsequent chaetiger increasing in number and become arranged in irregular to double rows; from chaetiger 8, more distinctly arranged in 2 semi-circular rows on slightly raised fleshy pads, until the end of fragment (=chaetiger 13).The uncini have a large main fang surmounted by several rows of small teeth; breast of uncini with a stout subrostral spine above basal prow;  handle not clearly observed. Posterior part and pygidium not observed. Tube uknown.
Remarks.  This is a rather interesting species represented by three small and slender, incomplete specimens whose generic placement is somewhat problematic.  It agrees with genus Rhodine in lacking cephalic plaque and having anterior uncini arranged in double rows appearing from chaetiger  5, however it lacks segmental collars. Provisionally we assign this specimen to genus Rhodine, until further evidence becomes available for its generic placement. This specimen further differs from other Rhodine species also collected from Falkland Islands in very small size and slender body, prostomium is directed anteriorly (straight) rather than bent ventrally as often seen in other species. The uncini are arranged in single, irregular and double rows, in mid chaetigers forming semi-circles, sitting on flashy pads.

Diagnosis. Small-sized species; voucher incomplete; composed of single, anterior fragment with 12 chaetigers, 10mm long and 1mm wide; colour in alcohol whitish to pale yellow.                                                                                             
Prostomium without cephalic plaque, but with high cephalic keel; prostomium together with peristomium  fused with first chaetiger. Appearance of a shallow depression anterior to first chaetiger, giving slightly “humped” appearance to prostomium,  but no true dorsal crest observed. Chaetiger 1-3 long (much longer than wide) with the first chaetiger longest and chaetigers 2 and 3 slightly shorter; chaetigers 4 to 9 short (about as long as wide), chaetigers 10-12 longer again. Chaetigers 2 and 3 with well-developed segmental collar; collar anteriorly entire, without any pronounced notches (at best with a wide, very shallow depression dorsally in large specimen); well-developed collars also observed on at least other fragmented body segments (likely from mid or posterior part of the body).  From chaetiger 4-9  whitish, ventral glandular shields present on the anterior half of segment.                                                                         
Chaetigers 1-4 with notochaetae only; notochaetae long and short narrowly limbate capillaries. Uncini from chaetiger 5 arranged in double, interlocking rows until  the end of 12 chaetigers-long fragment, with about 23 uncini per row. The uncini have a large main fang surmounted by several rows of small teeth; breast of uncini with a stout subrostral spine above basal prow; with medium length handle.                                      
Posterior part and pygidium not observed.                                                                                                                    
Tube: tube composed of small, tightly packed particles; speckled with mostly black particles mixed with fewer white particles and test of forams (refer to the image).
Remarks.  Specimen is consistent with genus Rhodine in possessing collared segments, uncini from chaetiger 5, arranged in double rows on several anterior chaetigers. Rhodine is a small genus with some species considered to have a cosmopolitan distribution, the last description of new Rhodine species dates to 1911. Of the Rhodine species previously reported from the region: R. antarctica, R. intermedia and R. loveni, the FI specimens appear to be most similar to R. antarctica (see table below), mostly due to dimensions of body segments, lack of obvious dorsal crest and presence of ventral shields on chaetigers 4-9 (presumably, Gravier (1911) reported these as “Aux quatrième, cinquième, sixième, septième, huitième et neuvième sétigères, on observe des anneaux blancs”). However full distribution of uncini with double rows as well as characters derive from the posterior, particularly the form of pygidium cannot be established. Other species belonging to genus Rhodine were also encountered in Falkland Islands collection and these species are compared in table below.

Diagnosis.  Medium-sized species, voucher incomplete; with 17 chaetigers-long in total fragmented into anterior fragment of 8 chaetigers (25mm long and 2mm wide) and additional 5 body fragments of varying lengths; colour in alcohol pale to yellow.
Prostomium (both specimens) without cephalic plaque, but with high cephalic keel; prostomium together with peristomium fused with first chaetiger, with a well-developed dorsal crest. First chaetiger long (much longer than wide); chaetiger 2 short (about as long as wide), rounded; chaetiger 3 long again, chaetigers short from chaetiger 4 until end of anterior fragments, rounded. Chaetigers 2 and 3 with well-developed segmental collar; anterior margin of collar, middorsally with a wide, very shallow depression; well-developed collars also observed on at least 3 other fragmented body segments (likely from mid or posterior part of the body).  From chaetiger 3-9 ventral glandular shields present on the anterior half of segment.

Uncini from chaetiger 5 arranged in double, interlocking rows, uncini in such arrangement until chaetiger 14, with about 48 uncini per row; from chaetiger 15 uncini arranged in single row. The uncini have a large main fang surmounted by several rows of small teeth; breast of uncini with a stout subrostral spine above basal prow; with medium length handle.                                                                                                                                        
Posterior part and pygidium not observed. Tube not observed.
Remarks.  Specimen is consistent with genus Rhodine in possessing collared segments, uncini from chaetiger 5, arranged in double rows on several anterior chaetigers. Rhodine is a small genus with some species considered to have a cosmopolitan distribution, the last description of new Rhodine species dates to 1911. Of Rhodine species previously reported from the region: R. antarctica, R. intermedia and R. loveni, the first two are considered endemic, but the third is cosmopolitan. The features separating the species (particularly R. intermedia and R. loveni) are not clear, but R. antarctica was described from small specimen, while the other two species are large bodied.  Falkland Island specimens are assigned here to R. cf. intermedia (see table below) (holotype of R. intermedia was collected in South Georgia) rather than to cosmopolitan R. loveni.  Further, characters derived from the posterior, particularly the form of pygidium cannot be established and chaetiger 2 is short not long in Falkland Island specimen (limitation of having only heavily fragmented specimens available needs to be taken into account). Other species belonging to this genus were also encountered in Falkland Islands collection and these are compared in the table below.

Voucher. SEA LION: station 3MFC.
Diagnosis. Voucher is a small to medium sized, incomplete specimen; 16mm long and 0.5mm wide for 15 chaetigers long fragment; preserved specimen pale yellow in colour. Chaetigers 1-2 very long (>2mm long), chaetigers 3 slightly shorter, chaetigers 4 – 8 short (about 1mm) and chaetigers 9 -14 about 0.5mm long, with chaetiger 15 getting longer again. Chaetigers 1-8 distantly separated by deep intersegmental grooves; chaetigers 9 -14 with segmentation indistinct, chaetiger 15 with distinct segmentation again. Chaetiger 8 with a large, semi-circular glandular pad on dorsum as typical for this genus, the pad as long as the chaetiger 8.                                                                                                            
Prostomium with well-developed cephalic plaque; cephalic rim with lateral (one on each side) and single mid-dorsal notches, anteriorly with shallow dips near mid-anterior peak (not developed into palpode). Nuchal organs wide and straight, bordering a very low lying keel-like structure, covering nearly full length of cephalic plaque.                                                                                                                                               
Notochaetae capillaries of two types – long, smooth, very narrowly-limbate chaetae (about 8 per fascicle) and more numerous (about 10 per fascicle) shorter capillaries. In chaetigers 1 -3 single neuropodial rostrate hook present, dentition of these uncini reduced; from chaetiger 4 approximately 8 rostrate uncini arranged in a single row; uncini with main fang and about 6 small teeth, with several thin fibrils (barbells) underneath the main fang; with manubrial constriction on its shaft. Posterior end and pygidium not observed. Tube not observed.
Remarks.  Falkland Island specimens are consistent with genus Clymenura as they possess ventral pad on chaetiger 8; well-developed cephalic plaque and neuropodia of chaetigers 1-3 with a low number (one) of rostrate uncini. Currently, there are no known species of Clymenura from the region (Leiochone singularis Gravier, 1907 is considered a nomen dubium). Another specimen consistent with genus Clymenura and assigned to morphospecies Clymenrua sp. 1 likely represent a different species. It mainly differs in the length of chaetigers (Clymenura sp. 1 has shorter chaetigers anteriorly and longer posteriorly, while Clymenura sp. 2 has opposite trend), the length of cephalic  keel  and development of dentition of uncini in chaetigers 1 -3.

Diagnosis. Small slender species; voucher complete (in 2 fragments); 16mm long and 0.3mm wide for 18 chaetigers. Anterior and posterior chaetiger short (about as long as wide), the mid-body chaetigers very long.
Prostomium fused to peristomium, forming a well-defined head with very low rim cephalic peak, strongly arched and rounded anteriorly. Nuchal grooves strongly curved outwards (arch-shaped). Eyes or ocelli not observed.
Notochaetae of two types -  long, thick, bilimbate capillaries with fine tips, around 3 per fascicle and short, thin, distally hirsute capillaries, about 3-4 per fascicle in anterior chaetigers. Neuropodia of chaetigers 1-4 with a single, stout, acicular spine, distally blunt and rounded, dark yellow in colour. Subsequent neuropodia with row of rostrate hooks, maximum 4 per ramus, reduced to 2 in posteriormost chaetigers.  Each hook with main fang and about 4 small teeth, with fibrils below the main fang; very long shaft with a pronounced localized swelling (breast).
Preanal segments without chaetae indistinct and difficult to establish (may be 2 or 3), similar to preceding chaetigers. Anal plaque present, well developed; strongly arched (perpendicular to the body) and resembles cephalic plaque; very low, smooth cephalic rim with a slight dorsal notch; with high pygidial keel. Anus dorsal, positioned just above the anal plaque. Tube unknown.
Remarks. Only one species in genus Notoproctus has been previously described from the area as Notoproctus oculatus antarcticus Arwidsson, 1911. Various reports of this species from the region suggest that more than one species could be present and possibly misidentified, particularly as this species is considered to occur from 218 – 5274m (Ehlers, 1913; Monro, 1939; Hartman, 1966,1967). Monro’s (1939) non-type material is housed at NHM collection and was re-examined. As already reported by Monro (1939) one specimen likely belongs to Nichomache. Others consistent with genus Notoproctus, but only one specimen is complete. This specimen is larger than Falkland Island specimens, eyes are absent, cephalic plaque has slight lateral notches, but has no dorsal notch.
Hartman (1966) states 18 chaetigerous and 2 pre-anal segments or 19 chaetigerous and 2 pre-anal segments and eyes absent. Hartman (1967) reported only 3 chaetigers with single spine, not 4.  Ultimately, comparison with holotype of Arwidsson will be necessary, but given the lack of eyes in Falkland Islands specimens these will be assigned to morphospecies Notoproctus sp. 1 until further evidence is available.

Large species, voucher is the only example of this species collected; complete specimen, about 65mm long and 5mm wide (including parapodia); posteriorly body segments very deeply incised and narrow, assuming shape of bellows of accordion. Prostomium not clearly observed due to partially everted pharynx. Pharynx only partially everted, proximal part smooth, without warts, not wrinkled; distal part not fully observed: distal region with 10 pairs of terminal bifid papillae, subdistal region about 20 rows of conical papillae (number of these per row not established). Jaws not examined. Inter-ramal cirri recurved; from chaetiger 14 where rudimentary, assuming enlarged foliose shape soon after, progressively increasing in size up to chaetiger 37; from chaetiger 38 foliose appearance lost, branchiae as triangular, fleshy lobe, decreasing in size posteriorly, eventually absent from around chaetiger 55. Parapodia unadorned without enlarged lobes; acicular lobes rounded with a conical tip; pre- and postchaetal lobes short; dorsal cirri small, conical; ventral cirri small, conical (refer to images of parapodia for details). Preacicular chaetae cross-barred; postacicular chaetae basally spinulose (otherwise smooth) in anterior parapodia, becoming more stout (often broken off) in posterior parapodia; chaetae and single aciculae amber in colour, chaetae of posterior chaetigers darker in colour. Pygidium present but damaged; a single achateous ring with dorsal annulated fleshy lobe.
Remarks. The characters observed in specimens collected from FI agree well with Nephtys paradoxa Malm, 1874 (type locality from Northern Europe Koster, Bohuslän, Sweden), which has been recently re-described by Ravara et al.

Of the known species of Ancistrosyllis Falkland specimens are most similar to A. groenlandica, McIntosh 1879 as ventral cirri begin from chaetiger 1 and dorsal hooks from chaetiger 5 (range in A. groenlandica is chaetiger 4-6, with chaetiger 5 most common). This species was described from 750m, Arctic Ocean, Greenland, Davis Strait, but since then has been reported from wide geographical and bathymetrical ranges and several authors provided re-description of this species (e.g. Blake, 1994; Böggemann, 2009), the goblet-shaped papillae were not reported before. The holotype of A. groenlandica is housed at NHM London and was re-examined as part of this study. Holotype is not in good condition, slightly desiccated, with most chaetae broken off. No goblet-shaped papillae were found in holotype, but it is not clear if this due to age/condition of the material (but these were not reported by McIntosh). Other differences include some subtle differences in the length of appendages (both specimens compared were of similar size). At present we do not consider these tentative differences sufficient to recognise Falkland specimens as a different species. Fresh material from the type locality as well as molecular evidence are needed to validate the supposed cosmopolitan distribution of A. groenlandica.

Voucher. Sea Lion: station 8MFA.
Diagnosis. Voucher is large, robust, complete (but in two fragments) specimen, anterior and posterior fragments is 20 and 17mm long respectively and 11mm wide (including parapodia) for 35 chaetigers; body dorsally purple; two narrow, white, ciliated horizontal lines on each segment.
Prostomium bilobed, rounded (about as wide as long), with very small (but discernible) cephalic peaks. Palps, smooth, long tapering into very slender tips. Three antennae present; ceratophore of median antenna large, with pigmentation, arising medially on prostomium; lateral antennae inserted ventrally; styles of all antenna very long and slender, covered by thin, elongated, distally slightly expanded papillae. Two pairs of very small, subdermal eyes in quadrate arrangement, situated laterally (not easily visible in dorsal view) near anterior and near posterior margins of prostomium.
Tentacular segment with few notochaetae; two pairs of tentacular cirri, their cirrophores large and cylindrical, their styles similar to those of antennae - thin, papillated, but shorter. Second segment with biramous parapodia, chaetae, a pair of elytra and ventrally with very long ventral cirrus (much longer than in subsequent segments) inserted basally and papillated (similar to antennae and tentacular cirri).
Elytra present, 15 pairs of elytrophore (35 chaetiger long specimen) on chaetigers 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31 and 34. Elytra large, milky, with entire surface covered densely by sharply conical microtubercles; margin appear smooth but under high magnification, few scattered, thin, elongated papillae observed.
Parapodia distinctly biramous; with notopodia much smaller than neuropodia; both rami with single, long acicula, extending into very long, thin acicular processes. Cirrigerous segments (those not carrying elytra) with large, broad, conical dorsal tubercule inserted at the same level as elytrophores of elytra-carrying segments; cirrophores of dorsally cirri very prominent, long cylindrical, inserted medially on notopodia (near fascicle of notochaetae), style of dorsal cirri very long slender, papillated similar to antennae and tentacular cirri. Ventral cirri, from chatiger 3, shortest of all appeandages, but still of considerable length, approaching the acicular tip; slender smooth; inserted medially on neuropodia. On ventrum, small digiform nephridial papilla detected from chaetiger 5.
Notochaetae numerous, of varying lengths, stout with distinct rows of spines and blunt tips, straw-coloured. Upper and middle neurochaetae strait, slender, very long, with rows of spines subdistally, tips of neurochaetae unidentate and hirsute; lower neurochaetae similar to upper and middle neurochaetae, but shorter, distally bent; with distinct rows of spines and also hirsute.
Pygidium with pair of very long, very slender, sparsely papillated lateral cirri.
Remarks. Genus Austrolaenilla is well represented in Southern Ocean, with A. antarctica being the type species of the genus described by Bergström (1916) from South Georgia. Currently 4 to 5 species are reported from the Southern Ocean (A. fulgens has been considered subspecies of A. antarctica). It is evident from Hartman (1964) that species have been confused in the past as specimens of Monro (1930) and of Fauvel (1936) are different species, which in turn reflects the variation reported by Bergström (1916) who recognised more than one morphotypes in his original description (his description appears to be based on syntypes). Falkland Island specimen agrees well with Bergströms (1916) type 4, which he described as very large (over 50mm long), with faint small eyes and elytral surface covered entirely by microtubercles (as oppose to type 2, which was smaller, less than 20mm long, well developed eyes with anterior pair dorsolaterally, microtubercules limited to small patch on elytra). A. hastulifera (Pruvot in Fauvel, 1936) would appear also to agree with the diagnosis of type 4. Recent molecular work also suggested that A. antarctica may represent species complex (Neal et al., 2014) and taxonomic revision of Austrolaenilla species from the Southern Ocean is needed. Juveniles of this species are commonly encountered in benthopelagic samples and were previously considered to be Herdmanella gracilis (see Neal et al., 2014 for details).

Voucher. Sea Lion: station 79MFB.
Diagnosis. Voucher is the only example of this species collected, not in good condition; robust, medium sized species; specimen is incomplete, only 10 chaetigers long fragment, 2.5mm and 2mm wide (including parapodia); body yellow to light orange in colour. All elytra missing, total number of elytral pairs unknown.
Prostomium bilobed, rounded (about as wide as long), cephalic peaks not discerned. Palps, smooth, long, tapering. Three antennae present; ceratophore of median antenna large, arising medially on prostomium; lateral antennae inserted ventrally; styles of all antenna long and slender, covered by thin, elongated papillae. Eyes not observed.
Tentacular segment with few notochaetae; two pairs of tentacular cirri, their cirrophores large and cylindrical, their styles similar to those of antennae - thin, papillated, but shorter. Second segment with biramous parapodia, chaetae, pair of elytra and ventrally with very long ventral cirrus (much longer than in subsequent segments) inserted basally and papillated (similar to antennae and tentacular cirri).
Parapodia distinctly biramous; with notopodia smaller than neuropodia; both rami with single, long acicula, extending into very long, thin acicular processes. Cirrigerous segments (those not carrying elytra) with conical dorsal tubercule inserted at the same level as elytrophores (on elytra-carrying segments); cirrophores of dorsally cirri very prominent, inserted medially on notopodia (near fascicle of notochaetae), style of dorsal cirri very long slender, papillated (similar to antennae and tentacular cirri). Ventral cirri, from chatiger 3, short, slender.
Notochaetae numerous, of varying lengths, stout with distinct rows of spines and blunt tip, straw-coloured. Upper and middle neurochaetae strait, slender, very long, with rows of spines sudistally, tips of neurochaetae unidentate and hirsute; lower neurochaetae of different type to upper and middle neurochaetae, shorter, subdistally expanded (falcate) with very faint rows of spines, narrowing into smooth (not hirsute) unidentate tip.
Remarks. Although the specimen collected here is very incomplete and not in very good condition, the characters observed show differences from A. cf. antarctica, also collected from Falkland Islands (see separate entry). Austrolaenilla sp. 1 has yellow to orange body colour and lower neurochaetae are distinctly different falcate, smooth tip, faint serration on the margin, while A. cf. antarctica is purple (dorsally) in colour and its lower neurochaetae are similar to upper and middle groups, with distinct serration on the margin and hirsute tips. Greater number of complete, better preserved specimens is necessary to fully diagnose this species and establish its identity, with a revision of this genus needed (see separate entry).

This species has been recently revised by Barnich et al. 2012 and we refer readers to this publication for details, including comparison with similar species from the region (E. notialis has not been found in Falkland samples, but given its distribution, it is likely to be present).
Distribution. Antarctic and Magellan regions, the continental slope off the northern coast of Argentina, Falkland Islands.

Euphionella patagonica Monro, 1936
Voucher. Sea Lion station: 24MFB and station 29MFB.
Diagnosis. Voucher specimens complete; large, 20 to 55mm long and up to 16mm wide (including parapodia), with 25 chaetigers (this number is constant), 12 pairs of elytra, fleshy pseudoelytra on cirrigerous segments and branchiae detected from chaetiger 4.
Prostomium bilobed, longer than wide; ceratophore of median antenna in anterior notch, lateral antennae inserted terminally, styles of antennae long, smooth, expanded subdistally then narrowing into slender tip; 2 pairs of very faint eyes situated posteriorly on prostomium. Large, thick palps densely papillated, reddish longitidunal line can be detected on each palp on inner side.
Twelve pairs of large leathery elytra, covering dorsum on segments 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25; lateral margin of elytra dorso- and ventrolaterally with many long, very soft, dense papillae; elytral surface always covered with small flattened, rounded microtubercules, additional with various number (usually around 30) small, distally inflated and papillated macrobtubercules; from around 4th elytral pair, very large, distally inflated papillated macrotubercules appear located on raised area around the attachments, varying in number from around 1-2 anteriorly to around 7 posteriorly. Fleshy pseudoelytra present on cirrigerous chaetigers (those not carrying elytra), distally with crenulated edge with large median crenulation and pair of shorter crenulations on each side, surface transparent; with 5 (in smaller voucher) to 10 (in large voucher) transverse lines and small rounded vesicles.
Parapodia biramous. Notopodia extremely reduced; with acicula; from 4th notopodium with few, short branchial filaments attached basally (can be easily overlooked); dorsal cirri with long smooth styles. Neuropodia massive, appear inflated; with short acicular lobe; edges sparsely covered by small papillae; ventral cirri very short, smooth.
Notochaetae, numerous but extremely soft and fine, finely serrated. Neurochaetae dark red to brown, very stout, large, unidentate, smooth spines up to 20 per fascicle, with 2-3 lowermost modified into spear-shaped tip. Nephridial papillae distinct from chaetiger 5 (although small can be detected from chaetiger 4). Pygidium simple lobe with a pair of short lateral cirri.
Remarks. Genus Euphionella is represented by four large bodied species (all with 25 segments), so far found only from deep-waters off South American continent:
Euphionella lobulata (Seidler, 1922) from Calbuco, Chile; E. patagonica Monro, 1936 from Patagonia; E. robusta Wesenberg-Lund, 1962 from Chile and E. besnardi Amaral and Nonato, 1985 from Brazil. Of those species Falkland Island specimens agree with Euphionella patagonica Monro, 1936 as it is the only species in which spear-shaped (also referred to as spatulate) chaetae in neuropodial fascicle were reported. It also agrees in having palps densely covered by papillae, long median antenna in relation to lateral antennae, nephridial papilla and ornamentation of elytra (detailed description given by Monro can be accessed here:
http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/28331#page/75/mode/1up). It is important to note that degree of ornamentation of elytra varies with the size of specimen and also in different body regions in each specimen. It is generally accepted that the first pair of elytra is not diagnostic in Polynoidae, however in large bodied Euphionella up to first 3-4 elytra can be without very large macrotubercules (possessing microtubercules and variable number of smaller papillataed macrotubercules only), which are mostly developed and present in greatest number in mid to posterior elytra. The transition between small and large papillated macrotubercules is gradual and determining the exact number of each type can be difficult. Monro's specimen is only about 20mm long, similar in size to smaller specimens encountered in Falklands collection, while the largest specimen collected from FI is 55mm long. The size variation was already noted by Wesenberg-Lund (1962) and Hartmann-Schröder (1965) who investigated specimens of 35 and 36mm in length respectively.

Diagnosis. Small, but robust species; voucher specimen with body complete, branchial crown missing; body 2mm long (body only) and 0.5mm wide; with 8 thoracic and 13 abdominal segments.
Collar as an enlarged lobe, wide ventrally, low laterally and dorsally; margin smooth, entire (not notched) ventrally; laterally and dorsally smooth but bent into slight folds; not forming pockets dorsally, not overlapping at dorsal midline; peristomial eye not observed. Glandular ridge on 2 present.

Remarks. Of Amphicorina species known from the area (see Table below), FI specimens are most similar to A. kocki (Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt, 1989) described from 68m at Bransfield Straits and A. pulchra from Elephant Is., 134-370m, which both possess similar number of abdominal segments. The specimens agree in terms of its body shape and shape of peristomial collar. However they differ in number and form of abdominal uncini (see comparative table below). The branchial crown is missing in FI specimens and characters derived from this feature cannot be compared. Other species belonging to genus Amphicorina known from the area possess much smaller number of abdominal segments (see comparative table below).

Voucher. SEA LION: station 49MFB.
Diagnosis. Small, slender species; voucher specimen with body complete, branchial crown missing; body 3.5mm long (body only) and 0.35mm wide; with 8 thoracic and 9 abdominal segments.
Collar as an enlarged lobe, wide ventrally, low laterally and dorsally; margin smooth, entire (not notched); not forming pockets dorsally, not overlapping at dorsal midline; peristomial eyes not observed. Glandular ridge on chaetiger 2 present. 
In thorax, mucronate chaetae absent, only limbate (hooded) notochaetae present, about 8 + 8 per fascicle; thoracic uncini acicular, 13 in first thoracic unciniger reduced in number to 8 in the last thoracic unciniger. Abdominal neurochaetae few, narrowly limbate; abdominal uncini rasp-shaped plate, numerous up to around 20 per ramus, with about 8 vertical rows of very small teeth (about 10 per row) above the main fang.
Pygidium fleshy triangular lobe, only slightly longer then wide; pygidial eyes not observed.
Remarks. Of Amphicorina species known from the area (see Table below), only two species were reported with 9 abdominal chaetigers. A. magellanica and A. kocki. The branchial crown is missing in FI specimens and characters derived from this feature cannot be compared. A. kocki has small teeth of abdominal uncini arranged in 4-5 rather than 8 rows, but description of this arrangement in A. magellanica was not given and cannot be compared, without access to the type specimen.

Voucher. LOLIGO: station L3FA
Diagnosis. Voucher is the only example collected; very small and slender species; voucher specimen complete, with branchial crown; body 1.5mm long, crown 0.75mm long, body 0.15mm wide; with 8 thoracic and 4 abdominal segments. Chaetigers 1-2 short (wider than long), chaetiger 3 longer, chaetigers 4-8 much longer than wide; 4 abdominal segments short, crowded.
Branchial crown with (probably) 3 pairs of radioles and 1 pair of non-vascularized ventral filaments. Distal end of radioles filamentous, without papillae. Collar most developed ventrally as a high lobe, laterally and dorsally as a low lobe; margin smooth with mid-ventral shallow notch; dorsally not forming pockets, not overlapping at midline. Peristomial eyes not observed. Glandular ridge on chaetiger 2 present.
In thorax mucronate chaetae absent, only limbate (hooded) notochaetae found, around 4 per fascicle; thoracic uncini acicular, few, reduced from 3 per fascicle to 1 in the last thoracic chaetiger. Abdominal uncini not clearly seen, assumed rasp-shaped.
Pygidium triangular lobe, pygidial eyes not observed.
Remarks. With only 4 abdominal segments, FI specimens cannot be ascribed to any known species from the region as all of these possess at least 5 or more abdominal segments and its assignment to genus Amphicorina is uncertain. Given its very small size, it could also represent a sabellid juvenile.

Perkinsiana? sp. 2
Voucher. NIMROD: N11FA.
Diagnosis. Voucher is a complete specimen; small to medium sized species, with 8 thoracic and approximately 52 abdominal chaetigers; body 9 mm long and 0.8 mm wide, branchial crown 6.5mm long. Thoracic and abdominal chaetigers similar, rather narrow, intersegmentally incised.
Branchial crown with 7 pairs of radioles; radioles lacking pigmentation; with long tips; with many pinnules; palmate membrane absent; ventral radioles shorter than dorsal ones; the base of the crown high. Radiolar appendages of dorsal lips prominent as long, narrow, lobe; with long, thin pinnular appendage. Collar somewhat oblique, covering the base of the crown; not developed dorsally and with two rounded lappets of medium height ventrally. 
Thoracic notochaetae mostly missing (broken off), superior chaetae not observed , inferior paleate (mucronate) chaetae with short tips observed. Thoracic tori short, not indenting the thoracic ventral shields; thoracic uncini avicular with rounded breasts and likely short handles (handle length not clearly observed, but appear to be no longer then distance between crest and breast); approximately 10 arranged in single row; companion chaetae with a flat and very long tapered blade at right-angles, with several minute teeth. Abdominal neurochaetae long, narrowly limbate, 5 per fascicle; additionally about 2-3 extremely narrow limbate shorter chaetae observed. Abdominal uncini with equally-sized teeth above main fang, covering half the length of the main fang, with long necks, only slightly enlarged breasts and short handles.
Pygidium as rounded lobe; no cirri or pygidial eyes observed. Tube not observed.
Remarks. The genus Perkinsiana resembles other genera, particularly Potamilla Malmgren, 1866 and Parasabella Bush, 1905; while Potaspina Hartman, 1969 can be distinguished with relative ease by replacement of typical thoracic uncini by acicular spines (Giangrande and Gambi, 1997). Knight-Jones (1983) re-define some of these (i.e. Potamilla lacks well developed radiolar appendages supporting the dorsal lips), while establishing genus Perkinsiana. Even though a clear synapomorphy for this genus is still missing (Rouse 1996, Capa 2007), the length of handle of thoracic uncini and development of hood of abdominal neurochaete has been considered of taxonomic importance. The genus Perkinsiana is particularly diverse in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters and has a confused taxonomic past (good regional summary and key provided by Giandgrande and Gambi, 1997 and more recently updated by Tovar-Hernandez et al. (2012). Falkland Island specimen agrees well and shows similarities with Sabellomma minuta (Treadwell, 1941) (type locality: Atlantic Ocean, Sao Sebastio, Brazil), which was considered to be Perkinsiana by Knight-Jones (1983), they agree in small size, possessing 7 pairs of radioles, around 10 thoracic uncini per ramus each with very short handles and possessing elongated, narrowly limbate abdominal neurochaetae. The new genus Sabellomma Nogueira, Fitzhugh & Rossi, 2010 was however recently established to house this and related species to account for presence of unpaired, simple eyespots along entire lengths of outer radiole margins. These were not observed in Falkland Is. specimen.

Claviramus sp. 1
Voucher. INFLEX: station 1MFA.
Diagnosis. Small and slender species; voucher specimen complete, with branchial crown; body 2.5mm long, crown 1mm long, body 0.2mm wide; 8 thoracic and 9 abdominal chaetigers.
Branchial crown with 5 pairs of radioles, basally connected by a very low palmate membrane; radiole with papillae, distally ends in a well-developed flange with long filament; 2 pairs of nonvascularized ventral filaments present. (Presence/absence and structure of the lips not determined at this stage).
Collar most developed ventrally as high lobe, low lobe laterally and dorsally as a low lobes; margin smooth with mid-ventral shallow notch; dorsally forming two lobes that just about meet at midline. Peristomial eyes not observed. Glandular ridge on chaetiger 2 present.
Collar uncini limbate notochaetae. Thoracic notochaetae of two types - long, broadly limbate and shorter paleate, about 3 + 3 per fascicle. Thoracic uncini acicular with long handles, breast as a narrow swelling, positioned very close to notochaetae, 3 per fascicle, each with main fang and rows of small, diminishing-in-size teeth covering half the length of main fang. Abdominal uncini appear Jasmineira-like (with reduced breast), main fang surmounted by several rows of small teeth; 4 per fascicle.
Pygidium triangular lobe, pygidial eyes not observed.
Remarks. The flanges on distal ends of radioles a feature clearly observed in FI specimen, are a hallmark of genus Claviramus (Fitzhugh, 2002). However Fitzhugh (2002) also reported abdominal uncini to be avicular, with enlarged breast. While it was not possible to observe abdominal uncini in clear lateral view in FI specimen, these do appear more of Jasmineira type, with reduced breast. This character requires clarification (only a single, very fragile specimen is currently available for examination). Currently, only 3 species of Claviramus are known (none from the geographical area investigated): C. candelus (Grube, 1863) from Adriatic Sea, C. grubei Fitzhugh, 2002 from Thailand and C. oculatus (Langerhans, 1884) from Madeira. The FI specimen represents a new species showing affinities with C. grubei and C. oculatus (sensu Cochrane 2000) in having filamentous ends to radioles distal to the foliaceous flanges (see discussion in Fitzhugh, 2002). It can be further distinguished from C. oculatus by presence of a glandular ridge on chaetiger 2. Claviramus grubei is marked by presence of this glandular ridge, but differs from FI specimens in possessing more abdominal chaetigers (12 versus 9) and greater number of radiolar pairs in branchial crown (7 versus 5), even though the holotypes are of the exact dimension (i.e. differences cannot be size related). This is a first record of genus Claviramus from South America and Southern Ocean.

Voucher specimens. INFLEX: station 2MFB.
Diagnosis. Small bodied, slender species; voucher specimen with body complete, but branchial crown missing; 6.5 mm long (body)  and 0.5 mm wide, with 8 thoracic and 19 abdominal chaetigers with 7 of these associated with pre-pygidial depression; colour in alcohol pale yellow. 
Collar well developed; of similar height all around, only slightly higher ventrally than dorsally; with mid-dorsal margins overlapping; anterior margin entire ventrally with a shallow midventral notch. Glandular ridge present on chaetiger 2, very narrow. 
Collar chaetae narrowly limbate arranged in single longitudinal somewhat oblique row; superior and inferior notochaetae of limbate, 3-4 per fascicle. Thoracic neuropodial uncini acicular, about 3 per fascicle.  Companion chaetae absent. Abdominal chaetae on short, slightly elevated neuropodia, with elongate narrowly limbate chaetae. Notopodia of anterior abdominal chaetigers with quadrate avicular uncini with five rows of similar-sized teeth over main fang, covering half its length, well developed breast and very short handle. 
Abdomen with a narrow pre-pygidial depression occupying 7 chaetigers, with high raised membranous lateral flanges connected anteriorly by a rounded membrane, flanges lower posteriorly. Pygidium well-developed, triangular lobe. Tube not observed.
Mehtyl green staining pattern: refer to plate accompanying this description.
Remarks. A commonly reported species Euchone pallida described by Ehlers (1908) from Kerguelen Island also lacks broad mucronate notochaetae. Ehlers (1908) based his description on relatively small holotype,  22mm long for body plus 14mm for branchial crown and 3 mm wide, for 8 thoracic and 32 abdominal segments, with 12 of those forming the pre-pygidial (anal) depression. Licciano et al. (2007) provided re-description of E. pallida and added valuable information on internal structure of the crown and methyl green pattern based on medium-sized specimens. However specimens of different sizes were considered to belong to E. pallida by different authors (i.e. Hartman, 1978) with considerable variation not just in size, but also number of abdominal segments and the number forming the anal depression. It is possible that different species were lumped under this name as number of abdominal segments is considered of taxonomic character in Sabellidae. In Falkland Island material, specimens with differing number of abdominal segments (19 and 27 respectively, also differing in number of both thoracic and abdominal uncini per ramus) and with different methyl green pattern (see comparative image) are here considered to be different species.  Neither of these two species is likely to belong to E. pallida of Ehlers, 1897 as these are much smaller in body size (6.5 and 9.5 mm as oppose to 22 mm) as it is often typical for deep-water fauna (specimens collected from  ~1000m), possess fewer abdominal segments and differ in staining pattern.  Licciano et al. (2009) provided description of methyl green staining pattern as:  a homogeneous dark coloration of thorax and abdomen with distinct intra-segmental furrow, except for presence of thin glandular ridge on chaetiger two, without stain on the collar as apparent from their Figure 1B. Euchone sp. 1 may correspond to what Hartmans (1978) recorded of as juvenile of E. pallida (see comparative table below). These small bodied specimens likely represent a new species (see comparative table for Euchone species recorded so far from Southern Ocean and Magellan region), but complete specimens with branchial crowns will be necessary to fully diagnose these species.

Mehtyl green staining pattern: refer to plate accompanying this description.
Remarks. A commonly reported species from the region Euchone pallida described by Ehlers (1908) has been already discussed in Remarks section of Euchone sp. 1 and 2. Euchone sp. 3 is another small bodied Euchone species collected from Falkland Islands, which can be distinguished by possessing a rather large (relative to its body size) pygidial lobe, which stains strongly.

Voucher specimens. VINSON WEST: station 1MFB.
Diagnosis. Small bodied, slender species; voucher specimen with body complete, but branchial crown missing; 3 mm long (body) and 0.25 mm wide, with 8 thoracic and 15 abdominal chaetigers with 5 of these associated with pre-pygidial depression; colour in alcohol pale yellow.
Collar well developed, flared; much higher ventrally than dorsally; mid-dorsal margins not overlapping; anterior margin entire without any notches (?). Glandular ridge present on chaetiger 2, very narrow.
Collar chaetae narrowly-limbate arranged in single longitudinal somewhat oblique row; superior notochaetae long, narrowly limbate, while inferior notochaetae short, broadly limbate (but not truly mucronate). Thoracic neuropodial uncini acicular, with main fang relatively slender in lateral view and with at least 6 small teeth. Companion chaetae absent. Abdominal neuropodial chaetae few, narrowly-limbate. Notopodia of anterior abdominal chaetigers with quadrate avicular uncini (not as robust as in other Euchone species); in frontal view resembling rasp-shaped plates of Amphicorina, with small teeth arranged in about 8 rows of approximately 15 teeth per row above the main fang; with well developed breast and very short handle.
Abdomen with a narrow pre-pygidial depression occupying 5 chaetigers, with high raised membranous lateral flanges connected anteriorly by a rounded membrane, flanges lower posteriorly. Pygidium well developed, triangular lobe. Tube not observed.
Mehtyl green staining pattern: refer to plate accompanying this description.
Remarks. Euchone sp. 4 shows similarities with Euchone southerni, which has been by now reported from different localities in the Atlantic Ocean - its type locality in Ireland; Gulf of Mexico (as Euchone cf. southerni) and Mediterranean Sea (Giangrande, 1989). This latter species is now considered as a new, but undescribed species (as Euchone sp. in Giangrande and Licciano, 2006). There are detectable differences relating to size, number of abdominal chaetigers, and incision of collar and staining pattern. Falkland Island specimen likely represents a new species; however, specimens with branchial crown (currently not available) will be necessary to fully diagnose this species.

Voucher specimens. Sea Lion: station 79MFB.
Diagnosis. Medium sized, robust species; voucher is a complete specimen with branchial crown; 15mm long for body and 7mm long for crown, 1.5mm wide; with eight thoracic and 23 abdominal chaetigers with 7 of these associated with pre-pygidial depression; colour in alcohol pinkish.
Branchial crown with 8 pairs of radioles and 2 pairs of nonvascularized ventral radiolar appendages. Collar well developed, higher ventrally than dorsally, with mid-dorsal margins overlapping, anterior margin entire ventrally with a deep midventral notch. Glandular ridge present on chaetiger 2.
Collar chaetae narrowly-limbate arranged in single longitudinal, somewhat oblique row; notochaetae of two types, superior notochaetae broadly-limbate, inferior notochaetae mucronate (about 8 per fascicle). Thoracic neuropodia uncini aciculae, about 15 per fascicle. Companion chaetae absent. Abdominal chaetae on short, slightly elevated neuropodia, with elongate narrowly limbate chaetae. Notopodia of anterior abdominal chaetigers with quadrate avicular uncini with five rows of similar-sized teeth over main fang, covering half its length, well developed breast and very short handle.
Abdomen with a broad pre-pygidial depression occupying 7 chaetigers, with high raised membranous lateral flanges connected anteriorly by a rounded membrane, flanges lower posteriorly. Pygidium small, bluntly rounded, triangular lobe. Tube not observed.
Remarks. There are two known species of Euchone with two types of notochaetae from the area. Hartman (1978) described E. heterosetosa from South Georgia, 2900m. Nearly a decade later Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt (1989) described similar species as E. undulocincta from much shallower depths of 133m off Joiville Island without providing comparison of the two species. These species clearly differ in size (see comparative table of Euchone species know from the area) and Falkland Island specimens are consistent with E. undulocincta, although description by Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt (1989) is rather brief and comparison with holotype is needed for confirmation. Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt (1989), for example, mentioned that the species is unique in possessing the ridge on chaetiger 2, this however is a generic-level character possessed by several sabellid genera.

Voucher specimens. Sea Lion: station 44MFB.
Diagnosis. Extremely small sized species; voucher with body complete (branchial crown missing); 2mm long (body) and 0.25mm wide; 8 thoracic and 10 abdominal chaetigers.
Branchial crown missing.
Collar very well-developed, much higher ventrally than dorsally; with smooth anterior margin; ventrally with an obvious mid-ventral notch; dorsally median lobes not overlapping, separated by a small gap.
Narrow glandular ridge around chaetiger 2.
Collar chaetae narrowly-hooded arranged in oblique rows. Following thoracic chaetigers with 3 types of chaetae (arrangement as observed in anterior thoracic chaetigers): 1. long, narrowly-hooded chaetae, about 3 per fascicle; 2. paleate (mucronate) chaetae of various lengths, about 4 per fascicle; 3. very short, broadly limbate chaetae, 3 per fascicle. Thoracic neuropodial uncini acicular, with several rows of minute, similar-sized teeth covering half the length of main fang; reducing in number from chaetiger 2 with 5 uncini to 2 uncini in chaetiger 8 (the last thoracic chaetiger). Companion chaetae absent.
Abdominal chaetigers with few (4 in anterior abdomen, reduced to 3 in mid and 1 in posterior abdomen); elongate, narrowly-limbate (hooded) chaetae. Abdominal uncini avicular (S-shaped), elongated, with reduced breast; up to 4 arranged in a single row in chaetiger 9 (first abdominal chaetiger), diminishing number posteriorly to 1 in the last abdominal chaetiger; with several rows of similar-sized teeth, occupying half the length of main fang.
Posteriomost chaetigers wide, narrowing abruptly into wider than long pygidial lobe with vey slender, short cirrus; pygidial eyespots not observed. Tube not observed.
Remarks. Several species in genus Jasmineira were collected from Falkland Islands in this study and these are summarised in the table on the genus page. All of these species had typical Jasmineira-like abscission zone, when branchial crown was missing, feature not observed in this specimen. It is difficult to assign this species accurately to a genus as key features of the branchial crown are missing and the specimens are so small. So this small species may also belong to genus Claviramus (of which example was also collected from Falkland Is. in this study). Jasmineira sp. 5 can be easily distinguished from other Jasmineira species (with the exception of Jasmineira sp. 6) by its very small size and low number of abdominal chaetigers. However the species can be easily overlooked or assumed to be a juvenile. Even though the species is very small, detail of chaetae could have been observed with relative ease in comparison to much larger species. A very similar morphospecies Jasmineira sp. 6 has also been collected; two species differ in staining pattern, form of pygidium and presence or absence of abscission zone, when branchial crown is missing (see details under entry Jasmineira sp. 6).

Several species in genus Jasmineira were collected from Falkland Islands in this study and these are summarised in table below as well as comparative image of staining patterns. These cannot be unambiguously assigned to the species previously reported from the area, mostly due to limitations of existing descriptions and the fact that branchial crowns are often missing. Further, Jasmineira sp. 2, Jasmineira sp. 3 and J. cf. regularis (itself having 2 forms) are very similar to each other, mostly differing in number of radiolar pairs (where possible to establish or at least estimate from abscission zone), number of abdominal segments and body shape of posterior end and pygidium as well as Methyl Green staining patterns. Additionally two more Jasmineira species with number of abdominal segments greater than 30 were distinguished Jasmineira sp. 1 with lateral incision on collar (not detected in other species collected here or reported in literature available on species known from the area) and Jasmineira sp. 4, which differs in its body shape, with segments having shallow, but distinct constrictions given them somewhat bead-like appearance. Of the species known from the area (see table below) only Jasmineira crumenifera Hartmann-Schröder, 1986 has over 30 abdominal segments, however it is unclear which (if any) of the specimens encountered here belong to this species and examination of the holotype is required.

Diagnosis. Extremely small sized species; voucher with body complete (branchial crown missing); 2.2mm long (body) and 0.3mm wide; 8 thoracic and 10 abdominal chaetigers.
Branchial crown missing; with a typical Jasmineira-abscission zone.
Collar very well-developed, much higher ventrally than dorsally; with smooth anterior margin; ventrally with an obvious mid-ventral notch; dorsally median lobes not overlapping, separated by a small gap.
Narrow glandular ridge around chaetiger 2.
Collar chaetae limbate (hooded) arranged in oblique rows. Thoracic chaetigers with long, narrowly-limbate superior chaetae, slightly shorter mucronate inferior chaetae with very long slender mucron and very short broadly hooded chaetae; 3+4+3 arrangement per fascicle observed in anterior chaetigers. Thoracic neuropodial uncini acicular, with several rows of minute, similar-sized teeth covering half the length of main fang; reducing in number from chaetiger 2 with 4 uncini to 1 uncinus in chaetiger 8 (the last thoracic chaetiger). Companion chaetae absent.
Abdominal chaetigers with few neurochaetae (4 in anterior abdomen, reduced to 3 in posterior, with 2 chaetae in last abdominal unciniger); elongate, narrowly-limbate (hooded), some longer, some shorter. Abdominal uncini avicular (S-shaped), elongated, with reduced breast; up to 4 arranged in a single row in chaetiger 9 (first abdominal chaetiger), diminishing number posteriorly to 2 in the last abdominal chaetiger; with several rows of similar-sized teeth, occupying half the length of main fang.
Posteriomost chaetigers narrowing gradually into fleshy, triangular pygidial lobe without any cirri; pygidial eyespots not observed. Tube not observed.
Methyl Green pattern: refer to image.
Remarks. Several species in genus Jasmineira were collected from Falkland Islands in this study and these are summarised in the table on the Jasmineira page. Jasmineira sp. 6 can be easily distinguished from the other species by its very small size and low number of abdominal chaetigers (n=10). However, another very similar species, with currently unresolved identification possibly belonging to genus Jasmineira or Claviramus was also collected from Falkland Is. This species Jasmineira? (Claviramus?) sp. 5 is of similar size and also possesses 10 abdominal chaetigers, but it lacks the obvious Jasmineira- abscission zone of branchial crown, its pygidium is broader and shorter, bearing a short, slender terminal cirrus. The two species also differ markedly in their Methyl Green staining pattern particularly when observed within minutes to hours of staining (refer to comparative image), the pattern somewhat converged after several days, but are not identical (refer to comparative image). Of the known species of Jasmineira from the area, J. macrophthalma Ehlers, 1913 also possess only 10-12 abdominal segments (no drawings were provided with the original description). However Ehlers stated that description is based on two slightly different forms (from two different locations - Kerguelen Islands and Wilhelm II Coast) and, therefore, it needs to be clarified if these were in fact different species. Both of his specimens had eyes (forming brown pigmented, crescent-shaped patch) according to Ehlers, which were not observed in Falkland Is. specimens.

Perkinsiana sp. 1
Voucher. SEA LION: station 5MFA.
Diagnosis. Voucher is a complete specimen; medium sized species, with 8 thoracic and 65 abdominal chaetigers; body 25 mm long and 1.8 mm wide, branchial crown 15mm long. Thoracic chaetigers longer than wide, abdominal chaetigers narrow, crowded.
Branchial crown with approximately 12 pairs of radioles; radioles with two pigmented area thoughout their length; with short tips; with many pinnules; palmate membrane absent; ventral radioles shorter than dorsal ones; the base of the crown high. Radiolar appendages of dorsal lips prominent as very long, narrow, pigmented lobe; with short pinnular appendage.  Collar somewhat oblique, covering the base of the crown; with a wide gap middorsally and with two high rounded lappets ventrally. 
Thoracic notochaetae with long broadly limbate superior chaetae and inferior paleate (mucronate) chaetae with long tips; arranged with about 10 + 8 per fascicle. Thoracic tori long, slightly indenting the thoracic shields; thoracic uncini avicular with very large, somewhat angular breasts and long handles (handle length at least twice the distance between crest and breast); about 40 arranged in single row; companion chaetae with a flat and very long tapered blade at right-angles, with several minute teeth. Abdominal neurochaetae long, with a basal broad knee and distal end narrowing abruptly, about 10 per fascicle; additionally very few, extremely narrow, shorter, limbate chaetae observed. Abdominal uncini with equally-sized teeth above main fang, covering half the length of the main fang, with long necks, only slightly enlarged breasts and short handles.
Pygidium as low, wide lobe; no cirri or pygidial eyes observed. Tube not observed.
Remarks. The genus Perkinsiana resembles other genera, particularly Potamilla Malmgren, 1866 and Parasabella Bush, 1905; while Potaspina Hartman, 1969 can be distinguished with relative ease by replacement of typical thoracic uncini by acicular spines (Giangrande and Gambi, 1997). Knight-Jones (1983) re-define some of these (i.e. Potamilla lacks well developed radiolar appendages supporting the dorsal lips), while establishing genus Perkinsiana. Even though a clear synapomorphy for this genus is still missing (Rouse 1996, Capa 2007), the length of handle of thoracic uncini and development of hood of abdominal neurochaete has been considered of taxonomic importance. Genus Perkinsiana is particularly diverse in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters and has a confused taxonomic past (good regional summary and key provided by Giandgrande and Gambi, 1997 and more recently updated by Tovar-Hernandez et al. (2012)). Of the known species of Perkinsiana, there are currently 5 species recorded from the area with large number of thoracic uncini (40+). Morphospecies Perkinsiana sp. 1 shows differences to those species as well as to Perkinsiana? sp. 2 also found in this study and likely represents a new species (see Table below). The main differences are its relatively small size and neurochaetae with a basal broad knee, distally narrowing abruptly.

Potamethus sp. 1
Voucher. Sea Lion: station 40MFB.
Diagnosis.  Large species; voucher is the only specimen encountered in this study; complete, with branchial crown; body 35 mm long, crown 17mm long, body 2mm wide; 8 thoracic and 39 abdominal chaetigers; chaetigers very crowded and very wide in posterior abdomen given the specimen somewhat swollen look towards the pygidium; colour in alcohol light tan to pink.
Branchial crown with 8 pairs of radioles, basally connected by a well-developed palmate membrane; radioles with pinnules to the tip; ventral filaments absent.
Collar most developed ventrally with distinctly elongate posterior peristomial ring, laterally and dorsally as a low lobes; dorsally forming two pockets, not overlapping at midline. Peristomial eyes not observed. Glandular ridge on chaetiger 2 present.
Collar uncini limbate notochaetae ranged in longitudinal rows. Thoracic superior notochaetae long, broadly limbate about 10 per fascicles and numerous, shorter mucronate chaetae arranged in 2 rows (around 9 chaetae per row). Thoracic uncini avicular with very long handles, breast as a pronounced swelling, about 14 per fascicle, arranged in single row, each with main fang and 4 small, diminishing in size teeth as seen in profile; with a row of smaller, hooked-shaped companion chaetae.
Abdominal neurochaetae composed of thin capillaries, around 6 per fascicle and row of 6 mucronate chaetae (narrower than thoracic mucronate chaetae); posterior neurochaetae change shape dramatically; in posterior abdominal segments neurochaetae as shorter and longer thickened (almost spine-like) narrowly limbate capillaries with very distinct long, thin mucrons. Abdominal uncini of anterior and mid abdominal chaetigers long handled, similar to thoracic unicni, around 20 per fascicle arranged in single row anterior and mid abdominal segments, reducing in numbers posteriorly.
Pygidium indistinct, very small triangular lobe; pygidial eyes not observed. Fragments of tube observed, composed of fine mud, greyish in colour, smooth without embedded particles.
Remarks. The FI specimen belong to genus Potamethus as they possess a girdle on chaetiger 2, and distinctly elongate posterior peristomial ring of the collar, although the form of thoracic uncini is distinctly avicular not acicular as otherwise common for species with girdle on chaetiger 2. Potamethus scotiae was described from Princess Martha Coast, around 2500m depth by Pixel (1913), however her original description was very brief (concentrating mostly on branchial crown and shape of collar, while at the same time providing drawings for chaetae only) and, therefore, of relatively little value. Nevertheless Pixel (1913) pictured and described only 1 type of abdominal neurochaetae, not 2 as clearly obvious in FI specimens. Knight-Jones (1983) re-examined holotypes and re-defined genus Potamethus. Based on drawings she provided for P. scotiae, the collar is not the same as for the one found in Falkland specimens. Knox and Cameron (1998) also provided description of P. scotiae, this time from the Ross Sea. The collar corresponds well with that of genus Potamethus, but they reported only one type of abdominal neurochaetae, as well as large number of radiolar pairs in comparison to FI specimens (15 versus 8).

Anguillosyllis palpata (Hartman, 1967)
Voucher. INFLEX: station 2MFB and VINSON WEST: station 5MFB.
Diagnosis. Small species, with distinctly long palps; robust body, dorsoventrally flattened, widest in middle tapering both anteriorly and posteriorly; 1.3-2.3mm long, 0.3-0.4mm wide; with 11 chaetigers; integument smooth. Proboscis not everted.
Prostomium slightly wider than long, with three short, smooth antennae of subequal length; eyes absent. Long, narrow palps fused for at least half their length. First segment with one pair of smooth, short digiform tentacular cirri.
Parapodia very long, cylindrical, uniramous. Dorsal cirri extremely long, thin and coiled, appear smooth, but very long weak articles detected under high magnification; present on all parapodia. Ventral cirri digitiform, inserted near distal end of parapodia.
Chaetigers with numerous unidentate, compound chaetae with differing lengths of blades decreasing inferiorly, shape of blades changes from pseudospinigers with wide, shallow serrations to shorter knife-like falcigers with distinct serration of margin within each bundle. Pygidium preceded by 2 pre-anal, achaetous rings, pygidium short bulbous, no cirri observed (likely broken off).
Remarks. This species corresponds well with the descriptions of Anguillosyllis palpata (see Hartman, 1967; Aguado and San Martín, 2008; Bögemann, 2009 for details) described from Southern Ocean, Drake Passage, off Cape Horn, Angola, Cape and Guinea Basins and found in bathyal and abyssal depths. Bögemann (2009) commented on great similarity of this species with South African Anguillosyllis capensis Day 1963, suggesting these may be conspecifics. Molecular evidence (Böggemann, 2009) suggests that abyssal specimens of A. capensis from SE Atlantic basins represent in fact three different species.

Diagnosis. Both vouchers posteriorly incomplete; very small, slender species; 1.1 and 5mm long, 0.15mm wide for anterior fragment with 10 and 40 chaetigers. Integument smooth; colour in alcohol pale yellow. Prostomium about twice as wide as long bearing three antennae and two palps. Palps distinctly longer than prostomium; fused throughout their length. Antennae smooth, arising nearly at same level near posterior margin of prostomium; lateral antennae distinctly shorter, spindle-shaped; median antenna very long (reaching back to chaetiger 3), slender, cirriform. Eyes present as a pair of tiny red eyespots (voucher 38MFB) or as two pairs, anterior pair as large spherical eyes (composed of several small eyespots), posterior pair as large rod-shaped eyes (composed of several small eyespots). Pharyngeal tube extending through 4 chaetigers, proventricle with around 20 muscle rings extending through chaetiger 4-6. First segment achaetous laterally with a pair of smooth, short, ovoid tentacular cirri.
Parapodia uniramous with smooth dorsal cirri similar to tentacular cirri in anterior chaetigers, becoming slightly longer digiform in latter chaetigers; dorsal cirri present in all chaetigers; ventral cirri conical, inserted near parapodial base.
Chaetae of 3 different types: type 1. as simple chaetae (usually one dorsal and one ventral) lacking in anteriormost chaetigers; long, slender, distally bidentate with several long aristae; type 2. as compound falcigerous chaetae with bidentate blades, their lengths decreasing inferiorly; type 3. as compound spinigerous chaetae with long bidentate blades; all compound chaetae distally bidentate; with the teeth widely separated in morphotype with eyes, but this gap appear much smaller in morphotypes with small eyes; all blades serrated with long spines over entire length of margin. Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. Falkland Island specimen belongs to two morphotypes with 2 pairs of large eyes (from ~500m depth) or pair of tiny eye spots (~1000m depth). Some minute differences were also observed in the degree of distal dentation of falciger and spiniger-like compound chaetae. Until molecular evidence becomes available, we consider these to be the same species. Both morphotypes correspond well with Exogone wolfi, which in turn has been reported from widespread geographical and bathymetrical ranges showing similar variation in eye development to the one observed here (see comparative Table below). This may possibly represent a species complex and molecular evidence is needed to clarify status of different morphotypes. Exogone minuscula Hartman, 1953 is Southern Ocean species, which is superficially also very similar to FI specimens (morphotypes with eyes), however Hartman reported unidentate not bidentate tips and simple chaetae show subdistal serration, but lack aristae. E. parasexoculata Hartmann-Schröder, 1993 from Argentinean part of the South Atlantic Ocean lack dorsal cirri on 2nd chaetiger.

Vouchers.  Sea Lion: station 7MFC.
Diagnosis.  Voucher is a complete specimen; very small, slender species; 2.8mm long, 0.25mm wide for 33 chaetigers. Integument smooth; colour in alcohol pale yellow.
Prostomium about twice as wide as long bearing three antennae and two palps. Palps about as long as prostomium; fused throughout their length. Antennae smooth, arising nearly at same level, positioned anterior to eyes; antennae spindle-shaped with median antenna slightly longer than lateral ones. Two pairs of large red eyes present, positioned close together, anterior pair large, cup-shaped, posterior pair smaller, spherical. Pharyngeal tube extending through 3 chaetigers; proventricle extending through chaetigers 3-6. First segment achaetous laterally with a pair of smooth, very short, rounded tentacular cirri.
Parapodia uniramous, short but distinct. Dorsal cirri missing on chaetiger 2, otherwise present, smooth ovoid, dorsal cirri; ventral cirri smaller than dorsal cirri, ovoid, inserted near parapodial base.
Chaetae of several different types, up to 6 per fascicle in mid segments, arranged in the following way (dorso-ventrally): type 1 one, simple, bidentate upper (dorsal) chaeta, long, distally expanded with distinct serration; type 2 one modified compound falciger, with expanded serrated joint, distally bidentate with very slender secondary tooth, short blade with margin distinctly serrated; type 3 three compound falciger, smaller and less developed than type 2, with small, serrated joint and short, distally bidentate blade with slender secondary tooth, margin serrated; type 4 one, simple, bidentate lower (ventral) chaeta, long, slender distally tapering into blunt, smooth tip; both simple chaetae lacking in anteriormost chaetigers. Pygidium damaged.
Remarks.  This species is very similar to  Exogone heterosetosa  McIntosh, 1885   described from the Southern Ocean,  off Marion Island and commonly recorded from the geographical area of interest here (see Hartman, 1966 for details), but it is clearly beset with many taxonomic problems. McIntosh's (1885) description is relatively brief and appears to be based on a specimen with damaged median antenna, which has led to subsequent misinterpretation of this species. Several other species were eventually synonymised with  E. heterosetosa, E. turqueti  Gravier, 1906;  E. heterochaeta  Augener, 1913;  E. clavator  Ehlers, 1913;  E. anomalochaeta  Benham, 1921 but it is not clear if this synonymy has always been justified. In our opinion the drawings of chaetae (see image below) by McIntosh (1885) of holotype of  E. heterosetosa  , by Benham (1927)  of E. anomalochaeta  Benham, 1921 and those of  E. clavator  by Ehlers (1913) represent different species, with different developments of modified compound chaeta and neither of which correspond to the Falkland specimens. Ehlers species is in fact very similar to  Exogone heterosetoides australis  Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1988 (as it possesses longer median antenna and long, robust spiniger-like modified compound chaeta), which has also been recoded from Falkland Islands in this study (see separate entry).
In recent times, San Martin (2005) provided description of  E. heterosetosa  (which he considered identical to  E. heterosetoides australis) based on Australian material and relying on non-type material of Haswell (1920) commented:  The Australian specimens agree with Haswells (1920a) description of E. heterosetosa; the original description did not specify the length of the median antenna, because the state of the preparation renders its presence doubtful (McIntosh, 1885); subsequent descriptions of the species, however, show a long median antenna. The original description by Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt, 1988 stated that median antenna is 3 times longer than lateral ones. In our opinion the species with long antenna belongs to  E. heterosetoides australis  rather than  E. heterosetosa  and the two are distinct species. Confusion cannot be clarified without a full revision of both species, but it is very likely that several species were in fact lumped under each name and both species were in turn mistaken for each other. It appears that the development of modified compound chaeta (ranging from short falciger-like to long or extremely long spiniger-like blade) and at which segment these appear in the body is of taxonomic importance, but has not been paid much attention to in the past.
In summary, Falkland Island specimens assigned to  Exogone  cf.  heterosetosa  possess short median antenna and modified compound chaeta essentially falciger-like, with short blade. Similar species encountered in this study with long median antenna and modified compound chaetae clearly spiniger-like with long blade is assigned to  Exogone heterosetoides australis  .

Vouchers. VINSON WEST: station 1MFB (best condition) and station 38MFB (all antennae missing) NIMROD: station N12FB (lateral antennae missing), INFLEX: 1MFA (median antenna missing).
Diagnosis. Vouchers to some extent damaged, with only voucher VINSON WEST, station 1MFB in good condition; the following diagnosis based on this specimen. Complete specimen; very small, fragile, slender species; 4mm long, 0.2 mm wide for 39 chaetigers. Integument smooth; colour in alcohol pale yellow.
Prostomium about twice as wide as long bearing three antennae and two palps. Palps about as long as prostomium; fused throughout their length. Antennae smooth, arising nearly at same level, positioned anterior to eyes; lateral antennae short, spindle-shaped; median antenna longest, about three times the length of the lateral ones, cirriform. Two pairs of distinct red eyes present, positioned close together, anterior pair large, cup-shaped, posterior pair smaller, spherical. Pharyngeal tube extending through 2 chaetigers, proventricle extending through chaetigers 3-5. First segment achaetous laterally with a pair of smooth, very short, rounded tentacular cirri.
Parapodia uniramous, short but distinct. Dorsal cirri missing on chaetiger 2, otherwise present, smooth ovoid, dorsal cirri; ventral cirri smaller than dorsal cirri, ovoid, inserted near parapodial base.
Chaetae of several different types, up to 6 per fascicle in mid segments, arranged in the following way (dorso-ventrally): type 1 one, simple, bidentate upper (dorsal) chaeta, long, distally expanded with distinct serration; type 2 one large compound spiniger, with expanded serrated joint and long, smooth, extremely thin blade, which may be distally minutely bidentate (tip often twisted, or folded over and difficult to observe with certainty); type 3 two to three compound falciger with short, bidentate; 4 one, simple, bidentate lower (ventral) chaeta, long, slender distally tapering into blunt, smooth tip; both simple chaetae present from chaetiger 1. Pygidium, rounded lobes, with long lateral cirri.
Remarks. This species corresponds well with Exogone heterosetoides australis (see Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1988 for details) described from Southern Ocean, Antarctic Peninsula (near Arctowski Polish Research Station, King George Island). The specimens differ in their development of antennae (completely missing in one voucher) and may therefore represent different regenerative stages, however in the best preserved specimen median antenna is about three times the length of the lateral ones as in description of holotype given by Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt (1988). Confusion with similar species Exogone heterosetosa (see separate entry and remarks under the species name Exogone cf. heterosetosa) likely happened in the past and it is possible that several species were lumped under the name Exogone heterosetosa, partially given by the lack of clarity on the length of median antenna in McIntosh's holotype. Also in E. heterosetosa reported in this study (see separate entry) the modified compound chaetae is more of a falcigerous form with short blade, not an obvious elongated form as described by Schröder & Rosenfeldt (1988) and as observed in FI specimens assigned here to E. heterosetoides australis. Careful re-examination of all material, particularly type material would be necessary to establish if it is in fact composed of several different species.

Diagnosis. Both voucher specimens incomplete specimens; medium sized species; 2 -2.3mm long, 0.8mm wide, for 17 and 20 chaetigers.
Prostomium trapezoidal to pentagonal; 2 pairs of eyes in trapezoid arrangement, anterior pair large cup-shaped, posterior pair smaller spherical. Palps broad, rounded folded downwards, fused basally. Three pairs of antenna, all styles missing, scars observable upon staining. Pharynx extends through 7 or 8 chaetigers; everted pharynx with large, single, dorsal tooth located on anterior margin of pharynx, opening surrounded by a crown of 10 soft papillae. Proventricule extends through approximately 10 chaetigers from chaetiger 7/8 to 16/17. Peristomium dorsally reduced, covered by first chaetiger; with a pair of tentacular cirri, long, slender, weakly articulated.
Parapodia uniramous; dorsal cirri mostly missing, where present, long, slender, weakly articulated (but not forming true articles) alternating in length; ventral cirri short and broad, ovate.
Chaetae all compound in 20 chaetigers, all located ventral to single, straight, blunt-tip acicula; directly ventral to acicula 2 slender spinigers, with very long slender blades, distally distinctly bi-dentate, margin with short serrations; other chaetae about 12 falcigers with varying length of blades (length decreasing ventrally), blades rather wide, with distinctly serrated margin, distally bidentate; simple chaetae not observed in 20 chaetigers. Pygidium unknown.

Remarks. This specimen belongs to genus Pionosyllis (or possible to other closely related genera, see San Martin et al. 2009 for details). Of the previously reported species from the geographical area of interest here, FI specimens show affinities with Pionosyllis cf. ehlersiaeformis Augener, 1913 recorded from the area by Hartmann-Schröder and Paraehlersia dionisi (Núñez & San Martín, 1991) (Pionosyllis elephantensis Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1992 is considered a junior synonym of this species) , which both possess long spinigers. More complete specimens are needed to be confirm the identity of Falkland specimens, for the time being we suggest morphospecies name Pionosyllis sp. 1.

Sphaerosyllis lateropapillata Hartmann-Schröder, 1986
Voucher. LOLIGO station L2FA
Diagnosis. Voucher is a complete specimen (some damage as dorsal cirri on many anterior and mid chaetigers are missing); small, slender species; 5.5 mm long, 0.3mm wide for 54 chaetigers; colour in alcohol pale yellow. Body integument, palps and parapodia papillated; papillation relatively sparse, dorsum more densely papillated then venturm; dorsally a distinct arrangement appears (best observed when Shirla-stained) with 2 longer, slender papillae positioned laterally on each segment, forming regular longitudinal rows across the body; small rounded papillae in between and across the dorsum.
Prostomium about twice as wide as long bearing three antennae and two palps. Palps short, fused along their length, short, slightly ventrally folded, with small papillae. Antennae smooth, flask-shaped, of equal size, with median antenna positioned posteriorly to the lateral ones. Two pairs of large, red eyes in trapezoid arrangement. Pharyngeal tube extending through 4 chaetigers, with proventricle extending through chaetigers 5-7, with about 12 large muscular bands. First segment achaetous laterally with a pair of smooth, short, flask-shaped tentacular cirri (similar to antennae).
Parapodia uniramous, distinct, papillated, with one of the longer lateral papilla positioned near the paprapodial base. Dorsal cirri often missing (missing in most anterior chaetigers), where present flask-shaped (similar to antennae and dorsal cirri) becoming progressively elongated in posterior chaetigers; ventral cirri first clearly observed from chaetiger 20, long thin, cirriform, inserted near parapodial base.
Chaetae of essentially two different types: type 1 simple dorsal chaeta; unidentate, spine-like, present in all chaetigers, anterior one with more acute tip, posterior ones with rounded tip, usually one per fascicle, two observed in mid body segments; simple ventral chaetae not observed (likely broken off); type 2 compound, heterogomph, falcigers with curved, unidentate, falcate blades, blades reduce in length in dorsoventral gradation in anterior parapodia; present in all chaetigers; 7 anteriorly, 5 posteriorly per fascicle. Acicula solitary, distally bent at right angle as typical for the genus. Pygidium wide, round lobe provided with two, lateral, elongated flask-shaped anal cirri (similar to dorsall cirri, but much longer).
Remarks. Falkland Island specimens agree well with Sphaerosyllis lateropapillata (Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1992) described from Antarctic Peninsula (63°16.40'S, 63°42.78'W), 300m. As the name suggests papillae are most distinct laterally, where they are longest. San Martín (2005) also reported this species from Australia, although palps seem longer in those specimens compared to those from the Southern Ocean, Falklands Islands.

Vouchers. VINSON WEST: station 1MFA; ENDEAVOUR: station E4FB (2 specimens).
Diagnosis. All vouchers posteriorly incomplete; medium sized species; body robust, dorsoventrally flattened, 2-4mm long, 0.5-0.8mm wide for anterior fragments with 18 and 27 chaetigers. Integument smooth; colour in alcohol pale pink to dark yellow; proboscis not everted.
Prostomium much wider than long bearing three antennae and two palps. Palps distinctly longer than prostomium, wide rounded lobes, basally free from each other; distally often folded over. Antennae long, thin, distinctly articulated, positioned anteriorly to eyes; lateral antennae slightly shorter (with around 25 articulations) than median antenna (with around 35 articulations). Eyes present, 2 pairs, brown-reddish, faint, positioned next to each other in almost horizontal line, with outer pair large cup-shaped, inner pair, small, spherical. Pharyngeal tube extending through 10 chaetigers, proventricle with small muscle rings extending through chaetigers 11-25. First segment achaetous laterally with a pair of long, slender, distinctly articulated tentacular cirri (similar to antenna). 
Parapodia uniramous; with long, slender, distinctly articulated dorsal cirri (similar to tentacular cirri and antennae) of alternating lengths, longer ones with about 45 and shorter ones with about 20 articulations; ventral cirri only weakly articulated, slender, long (just surpassing the paprapodia), inserted basally.
Chaetae all compound falcigers, about 6 per fascicle; all with very short, thick, smooth, bidentate blades. Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. Ehlers (1901) described S. sclerolaema from Strait of Magellan. Monro (1930) reported this species from Falklands based on 2 damaged specimens, however his illustration of chaetae fits those of specimen collected here well - only falcigers, with few extremely short, thick smooth, distinctly bidentate hooks. However, it is not clear if Ehler's and Monro's specimens represent the same species. Some authors, consider S. scerolaema junior synonym of Haplosyllis spongiphila (Verrill, 1885) (e. g. Blake, 1995). Additionally, Hartmann-Schröder described very similar species Typosyllis bifida from Southern Ocean, South Shetlands, 488m, which however lacks eyes.

Diagnosis. Voucher is a single specimen collected, complete specimen in good condition; small, slender species; 8.5mm long and 0.3mm wide for 65 chaetigers; body in alcohol pale yellow, integument smooth. 
Prostomium pentagonal bearing three antennae and two palps. Palps distinctly longer than prostomium, broadly triangular lobes, basally free from each other. Antennae long, thin, distinctly articulated, positioned anteriorly to eyes; lateral antennae slightly shorter (with around 25 articulations) than median antenna. Eyes present, 2 pairs, reddish, very small. Pharyngeal tube extending through 8 chaetigers, proventricle with small muscle rings extending through chaetigers 9-17, partially extended with single dorsal tooth positioned near anterior margin of pharynx. First segment achaetous laterally with a pair of long, slender, distinctly articulated tentacular cirri (similar to antenna).
Parapodia uniramous; with short, slender, distinctly articulated dorsal cirri, similar to tentacular cirri and antennae, but much shorter, of alternating lengths, longer ones with about 15 and shorter ones with around 10 articulations; ventral cirri only weakly articulated, slender, just about reaching the tip parapodia, inserted medially. In mid-body chaetiger parapodia with 2 aciculae (not protruding) through integument, one with spatula-like tip, and another with subdistally bulge and tapering tip.
Chaetae all compound falcigers, about 12 per fascicle; with varying length of blades (but no true spinigers), distally bidentate with curved tip and serrated margins. Pygidium rounded lobe with 2 very long, weakly articulated lateral cirri.
Remarks. Although FI specimen is in a good condition, assigning it to a named species is difficult due to taxonomic complexities of the species rich genus Syllis and resulting confusion of taxonomic reports. Revision of Syllis species from the region will be necessary, including clarification of reports of Northern European species reported from the area.

Diagnosis. Medium sized species represented by two complete (even if fragmented) specimens; 26mm long and 2.2mm wide for 65 chaetigers and 41mm long and 3mm wide for 75 chaetigers.
Prostomium subspherical, about as wide as long, with a V-shaped posterior margin, extending over the first chaetiger; a pair of nuchal organs clearly visible near the posterior corners of prostomium; a pair of conical antennae in the anterior corners of the prostomium and a pair of palps inserted posteriorly on ventrum the prostomium. Proboscis not everted. Inter-ramal cirri involute; from chaetiger 3 where rudimentary (easily overlooked, revealed by Shirlastain); slender throughout, progressively increasing in size up to mid body then decreasing in size posteriorly, eventually absent from the last 5 chaetigers. Parapodia biramous; complex with enlarged foliose postchaetal lobes in both rami (refer to the image for details). Dorsal cirri small, conical in chaetiger 1; from chaetiger 2 foliose, round, distally abruptly produced into shapely, slender tip; increasing in size till mid body then decreasing in size posteriorly, becoming very small and assuming nearly conical shape in the last 5 chaetigers. Ventral cirri particularly well developed in chaetiger 1, where bulbous with wide base and slender distally; well developed in other chaetigers, assuming more slender skittle-shaped to cirriform form; becoming very small digiform in posterior chaetigers. Preacicular chaetae cross-barred; postacicular chaetae spinulose along most of its shaft and single aciculae light yellow in colour, similar throughout the body length. Pygidium as terminal, blunt conical lobe.
Remarks. Specimens assigned here to Aglaophamus cf. peruana agree with Hartmans (1940) species particularly in that tiny branchiae detected from chaetiger 3 and both specimens posses various enlarged lobes and foliose dorsal cirrus. There are possibly some differences in the shapes of various lobes (Hartmans description is rather brief, but accompanied by drawings) and direct comparison with the holotype would be necessary to determine this. Falkland Islands specimen in fact show similarity to two other species with enlarged foliose lobes known from the region - Aglaophamus trissophyllus and Aglaophamus foliosus. Aglaophamus trissophyllus (known for reaching very large size) has a confused taxonomic history. It was originally described by Grube (1877) from the Kerguelen Is, while Hartman (1967) described A. ornatus from the deep Bransfield Straits, which was later synonimized with A. trissophyllus. Hartman (1967) also described another similar species as Aglaophamus foliosus, from deep-water (S. Sandwich Is. in 1482m and Cape Horn 1906-2013m) and questionably from Falkland Is. in 578m. Examination of non-type material of A. trissophyllus collected from Kerguelen Is. (type locality of Grubes A. trissophyllus) available at NHM collection was undertaken to draw comparisons with Falkland Is. specimens and A. folisosus (based on Hartmans description and images). These observations were summarized in table below; for images of parapodia refer to comparative figure. Further work, accompanied by molecular studies will be necessary to fully resolve the status of Falkland Islands specimens collected here.

Voucher. INFLEX: station 5MFB.
Diagnosis. Small sized species; voucher incomplete (in two fragments), 29mm long and 2.8mm wide for 53 chaetiger long fragment.
Prostomium somewhat ovate, longer than wide, with a V-shaped posterior margin, extending over the first chaetiger; a pair of nuchal organs near the posterior corners of prostomium; a pair of conical antennae in the anterior corners of the prostomium and a pair of palps inserted posteriorly on ventrum the prostomium. Proboscis not everted. Branchiae (inter-ramal cirri) involute; appearing from chaetiger 9, where very small; getting progressively large, but not very coiled (only distally curved inwards); present until end of 53 chaetiger long fragment, where very small again. Parapodia biramous; unadorned - no particularly enlarged lobes present, with the exception of superior lobe over notopodia, which is erect and enlarged (refer to the image for details). Dorsal cirri small, conical in chaetiger 1; from chaetiger 2 small, conical to slightly oval, similar throughout (refer to the image). Ventral cirri particularly well developed in chaetiger 1, where skittle-shaped (slender, but with wider base and thin distally); small, conical in other chaetigers. Preacicular chaetae stout, short, cross-barred in distal half of the shaft; of the same form in both rami. Postacicular chaetae long (particularly long in neuropodia), stouter spinulose and slender (appearing) smooth chaetae present. Single acicular present in each ramus, acicular with very long, thin tip, distally strongly bent. Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. Of several Aglaophamus species with the late start of branchiae and relatively simple, unadorned parapodia known from the region, the Falkland Island specimen corresponds well to A. posterobranchus (see aslo remarks under Aglaophamus sp. 2 and A. sp. 3). It agrees in the size of specimen, origin of branchiae, shape of prostomium, form of dorsal and ventral cirri and shape of parapodia with rudimentary preacicular lobes in both rami, sharply conical acicular lobes in both rami and presence of superior lobe over notopodia, which is erect and enlarged, even in posterior chaetigers (in 53 chaetigers long fragment). Hartman (1967) reported that branchiae may start from chaetiger 9-13 (most commonly 12) and in some specimens not before chaetiger 16. This variation seems to encompass variation encountered in Aglaophamus specimens collected from Falklands Islands, but upon more thorough examination, some of these were assigned to different morphospecies. Aglaophamus sp. 2 is the most similar to specimen assigned here to A. posterobranchus, but its notopodial cirrus is more developed and of foliose form. Aglaophamus sp. 3 with branchiae from chaetiger 15 or not present in 16 chaetiger long fragment lacked the erect, enlarged lobe above notopodia, which is clearly present (even in anterior chaetigers) in specimen assigned here to A. posterobranchus and reported by Hartman (1967) in holotype. Both Aglaophamus sp. 2 and 3 are represented by very small specimens (2.2-3mm long in ","Aglaophamus posterobranchus Hartman, 1967"

Prostomium subspherical, about as wide as long, with a distinct V-shaped posterior margin, extending over the first chaetiger; with a pair of nuchal organs near the posterior corners of prostomium; a pair of conical antennae in the anterior corners of the prostomium and a pair of palps inserted posteriorly on ventrum the prostomium. Proboscis not everted.
Branchiae (inter-ramal cirri) involute; appearing from chaetiger 4, small, increasing in size and present until the end of 23 chaetigers long fragment; not coiled, mostly straight and only distally curved inwards. Parapodia biramous; unadorned - no particularly enlarged lobes present, with the exception of superior lobe over notopodia, which is erect and enlarged (refer to the image for details); preacicular lobes rudimentary in both rami; acicular lobes sharply conical with a single acicula in both rami; postchaetal lobe in neuropodia somewhat enlarged, but not exceeding the tip of acicular lobe. Neuropodia with a distinct small, conical protuberance (refer to images). Dorsal cirrus small, conical in chaetiger 1; in subsequent chaetiger, very slender, cirriform, reaching up to 1/3 of the length of corresponding branchia where longest. Ventral cirri particularly well developed in chaetiger 1, where skittle-shaped (slender, but with wider base and thin distally); well developed in other chaetigers, tapering, cirriform.
Preacicular chaetae stout, cross-barred in both rami. Postacicular chaetae in notopodia long, stouter spinulose and these are extremely long in neuropodia, appearing silky (shining and silvery). Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. This Aglaophamus species has very long postacicular chaetae in neuropodia, with silky appearance. Of the known species of Aglaophamus known from the area, it is most similar to A. digitatus Hartman, 1967 in form of parapodia sharply conical acicular lobes, enlarged lobes above notopodia and importantly the presence of small conical protuberance on neuropodia. Two species differ in the shape of prostomium (very narrow and elongated in A. digitatus), start of the branchiae (from chaetiger 7, not 4 in A. digitatus) and form of dorsal cirrus (foliose, not cirriform in A. digitatus). This specimen likely represent a new species, however greater number of specimens and observation of proboscis will be necessary to fully diagnose this species.

Voucher. SEA LION: station 1MFC and station 8MFA.
Diagnosis. Small sized species; all vouchers incomplete, the largest voucher (SEA LION: station 8MFA) 3mm long and 0.8mm wide for 20 chaetiger long fragment. Prostomium subspherical, about as wide as long, with a V-shaped posterior margin, extending over the first chaetiger; a pair of nuchal organs near the posterior corners of prostomium; a pair of conical antennae in the anterior corners of the prostomium and a pair of palps inserted posteriorly on ventrum the prostomium. Proboscis not everted. Branchiae (inter-ramal cirri) involute; appearing abruptly (of similar size to those in subsequent chaetigers) from chaetiger 9; small; present until end of 20 chaetiger long fragment. Parapodia biramous; unadorned - no particularly enlarged lobes present, with the exception of superior lobe over notopodia, which is erect and enlarged (refer to the image for details). Dorsal cirri small, conical in chaetiger 1; from chaetiger 2 small, somewhat foliose, oval, distally abruptly produced into sharp, slender tip (refer to the image). Ventral cirri particularly well developed in chaetiger 1, where skittle-shaped (slender, but with wider base and thin distally); well developed in other chaetigers, tapering, cirriform. Preacicular chaetae stout, cross-barred in both rami. Postacicular chaetae in notopodia long, stouter spinulose and slender (appearing smooth) present; in neuropodia long, slender, appearing faintly cross-barred (articulation longer than in cross-barred pre-acicular chaetae). Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. Several Aglaophamus species with the late start of branchiae and relatively simple, unadorned parapodia similar to the FI specimens are known from the region. A. erectanoides Hartmann-Schröder, 1965 where branchiae appear from chaetigers 8-10, A. posterobranchus Hartman, 1967 where branchiae start between chaetigers 9-16 (mostly 12), A. groenlandiae Hartman, 1967 with branchiae from chaetiger 12, A. paramalmgreni Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt, 1992 with branchiae from chaetiger 12 and A. digitatus  Hartman, 1967 with branchiae from chaetiger 7. Of these, A. posterobranchus, and A. digitatus also possess enlarged superior lobe above notopodia as does Falkland Is. specimen (this lobe is also present, but rudimentary in A. paramalmgreni and A. groenlandiae, while absent in A. erectanoides). Aglaophamus digitatus also shares foliose form of dorsal cirrus, which appears to be much smaller than in Falkland Island specimens, and protrudes well beyond any other lobe associated with notopodia. Further differences lie in the shape of prostomium, which is very narrow and elongated and in presence of small conical protuberance in notopodia. At present we cannot assign Falkland Island morphotypes unambiguously to any species know from the area, but further work will be necessary to establish if it represents a new species. Given its very small size we cannot exclude possibility that it is a juvenile.

Diagnosis. Small sized species; both vouchers incomplete, the largest voucher 2.2-2.4 mm long and 0.5mm wide for 16 and 20 chaetiger long fragments. Prostomium pentagonal, slightly longer than wide, with a V-shaped posterior margin, extending over the first chaetiger; a pair of inconspicuous nuchal organs near the posterior corners of prostomium; a pair conical antennae (short, but longer than in other species) in the anterior corners of the prostomium and a pair of palps inserted posteriorly on ventrum the prostomium. Proboscis not everted. Very small branchiae appear from chaetiger 15 (not found in 16 chaetiger long fragment); very small.
Parapodia biramous; sharply conical, unadorned, without any enlarged lobes present. Dorsal cirri very small, digiform in all chaetigers; ventral cirri similar to dorsal cirri. Preacicular chaetae stout, cross-barred in both rami. Postacicular chaetae long, spinulose in both rami. Pygidium not observed.
Remarks.  Several Aglaophamus species with the late start of branchiae and relatively simple, unadorned parapodia are known from the region similar to the Falkland Island specimens. A. erectanoides Hartmann-Schröder, 1965 branchiae appear from chaetigers 8-10, A. posterobranchus Hartman, 1967 where branchiae start between chaetigers 9-16 (mostly 12), A. groenlandiae Hartman, 1967 with branchiae from chaetiger 12, A. paramalmgreni Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt, 1992 with branchiae from chaetiger 12 and A. digitatus  Hartman, 1967 with branchiae from chaetiger 7. Of these, A. posterobranchus, and A. digitatus possess enlarged superior lobe above notopodia. This lobe is also present, but rudimentary in A. paramalmgreni and A. groenlandiae, while absent in A. erectanoides. No such lobes were observed in Falkland Island specimens (although only short fragments are available for examination, these lobes are generally best developed in anterior and mid body chaetigers). Falkland Island specimen further differ from A. erectanoides in more posterior start of branchiae (from chaetiger 15 as opposed to 8-10). At present we cannot assign Falkland Island morphotypes unambiguously to any species known from the area and further work will be necessary to establish if these represent a new species. Given their very small size we cannot exclude the possibility that these are juveniles.

Ophelina farallonensis  Blake, 2000
Voucher specimens. Sea Lion: Station 53MFC
Diagnosis. Body small, cylindrical, rigid, glossy, sleek in appearance (almost nematode-like) (Plate 1a.), with mid ventral groove throughout; annulations poorly developed; with 18 segments; 4mm long for body and 0.6mm for length of caudal funnel, body 0.3mm wide; colour in alcohol pale yellow to white. Branchiae entirely absent. Prostomium (Plate 1b.) conical tapering into pointed tip bearing a small terminal palpode; pair of very small red eyes appear to be present (Plate 1b.); lateral nuchal organs not conspicuous. Parapodia bi-ramous, very reduced, the last 4 not shortened and crowded. Chaetae all slender capillaries, notochaetae longer than neurochaetae; the chaetae of the last segment longer than in preceding segments. Anal funnel long (approximately 1/5 of total worm length), thin, cylindrical, bearing a slender cirrus positioned ventrally from near posterior end (Plate 1c.); in majority of specimens the anal funnel has been lost.
Remarks. The specimen collected from Falkland Islands agree well with the description of O. farallonensis a deep species from Northern California (Blake, Hilbig & Scott 2000). The future studies, including molecular techniques may confirm if the Falkland Island specimens belong to this species. To complicate matters further, the abranchiate species from northern European Ophelina abranchiata Støp-Bowitz, 1948 was described from the specimen missing the anal funnel and later authors described funnel in O. abranchiata consistent with the one in O. farallonensis (Blake, 2000). In recent work on North Sea Opheliidae, Kongsgrud et al. (2011) reported that the only morphological difference between two species is the size, with adult specimens of O. abranchiata (10 mm long and 0.8 wide) being considerably larger than O. farallonensis (4.5 mm long and 0.35 mm wide). Additionally records of abranchiate opheliid with 30 segments - Ophelina nematoides - from Antarctic waters can be found (Harman 1966). This species (if valid and not described from a damaged specimen) is clearly different from FI material in having a much greater number of segments.

Ophelina breviata (Ehlers, 1913)
Voucher specimens. Vinson West: Station 3BMFA; Easting: 562480; Northing: 4534323; 433 m.
Diagnosis. Body long, linear; 9 mm long, 0.75 mm wide; segments number 29 (Plate 1a.); body with longitudinal ventral groove; last four chaetigers characteristically short and crowded, pushed towards mid-ventral line. Prostomium conical, longer than wide, terminating in a small palpode (Plate 1a,b.); with pair of nuchal organs appearing as reddish to brown spots. Branchiae cirriform (Plate 1b.), on all chaetigers except first one and last four; small and thin in mid body region. Anal cylinder long, smooth, with the dorsal edge slightly longer than the ventral edge (Plate 1c.), ending in several small indistinct lobes (Plate 1d.).
Remarks. Ophelina breviata has been commonly reported from Antarctic and South American waters (Ehlers 1913; Monro 1930; Monro 1939; Hartman, 1953; Hartman 1966; Hartman 1978; Elias et al. 2003; Maciolek and Blake 2006). In material from Falkland Islands, many specimens with branchiae missing in the middle were also found and although these could have been superficially assigned to O. breviata (given the similarity of anal funnel with extended dorsal lobe) with branchiae assumed missing, these in fact represent a different species assigned here to Ophelina cf. cylindricaudata (see below). Similar observation was made by Maciolek and Blake (2006), who suggested that material examined by Hartman (1978) from the Weddell Sea and Hero Inlet, which lacked branchiae on the majority of middle body chaetigers may represent a species distinct from O. breviata; perhaps O. cylindricaudata (Hansen 1878), as reported by Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt (1989) as a new record for the Antarctic.

Diagnosis. Body long, linear, 10.5 -12mm  long (inclusive of 1.3-1.5mm length of anal funnel) and 0.75-0.9mm wide; segments number 28 (irrespective of the size of the specimens); colour in alcohol yellow; body with longitudinal ventral groove; last four chaetigers characteristically short and crowded (Plate 1c). Prostomium conical, longer than wide, sharply pointed, with a small palpode and a pair of large, well-developed, reddish to brown nuchal organs (Plate 1b.). Branchiae cirriform, 8 pairs present on chaetigers 2-9 (well developed in chaetigers 2-7, very small and easily overlooked on chaetigers 8-9) (Plate 1a.), absent from mid-body region, 5 pairs present in the posterior region on chaetigers 19-24 (Plate 1c.), last four crowded chaetigers without branchiae. Anal cylinder long, smooth or faintly and irregularly ringed, with the dorsal edge longer than the ventral edge (Plate 1d.); ventral filament of anal tube missing, but small scar can be detected (Plate 1d.).
Remarks. Hansen (1878) described Ophelina cylindricaudata (as Ammotrypane cylindricaudatus) from two specimens collected in 763m and 911 m off the coast of Norway. Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt (1989, 1991) recorded the species from the Antarctic accepting the description and illustration provided by Stop-Bowitz (1945). However, it is possible that the Antarctic species is not the same as O. cylindricaudata (Hansen), which has been recorded primarily from Arctic waters and further analysis, including molecular techniques encompassing additional material from both Arctic and Antarctic waters is necessary before a conclusion can be reached.
Distribution.  O. cylindricaudata  is known from Arctic and Antarctic Seas, 7-4663 m; Southern Ocean material of O. cylindricaudata sensu Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt (1989) was recorded from ca. 65-600 m, Falkland Islands.

Body long, linear, with deep ventral groove, dorsal surface rugose and distinctly annulated (Plate 1c.). Prostomium conical (Plate 1b.), terminating in large palpode; with a pair of large reddish to brown nuchal organs. Branchiae present from chaetiger 2 (Plate 1b.), absent from last six chaetigers, all cirriform, large, only slightly reduced in size in the most posterior segments. The last 4 chaetigers not particularly short and crowded. Anal funnel scoop-shaped (Plate 1d.), with a ventral cavity and a pair of large cirri inserted ventrally and long, slender cirri encircling the rim of the funnel.
Remarks. In Falkland Islands material only two specimens were found showing all characters above, while several more damaged specimens were also observed. Damage was to the posterior region with branchiae generally missing after segment 20 (but a few could still be observed) as well as all cirri associated with anal funnel missing. The distinctive anal funnel on this species is very similar to that found on the widespread species Ophelina acuminata. Nevertheless, Ehlers (1900) erected A. scaphigera for the Antarctic species. While some authors (Elias et al., 2003) report O. cf. acuminata from 33-71 m off SE Brazil, most authors consider A.scaphigera to be a valid species at present. Until Ehlers types can be examined and compared with O. acuminata using both morphological and molecular approach, no further conclusions can be drawn.

Voucher. Endeavour: station E6FA
Diagnosis.  Voucher is a complete specimen, body long, slender, fragment 15mm long and 0.6mm wide. Tube strongly annulated as typical for the genus, muddy, soft. Thorax composed of 14 chaetigers, of which 11 uncinigers; abdomen posteriorly incomplete; abdomen with 24 uncinigers. First 5 thoracic chaetigers short, subsequent chaetiger progressively longer. Prostomium simple, spade-shaped lobe at anterior end, with a pair of large, but faint red eye-spots. Buccal tentacles not extended, tips smooth. Three pairs of branchiae, arranged in two groups on chaetiger 1, each group with median branchia anteriorly displaced (its branchiphore not visible in dorsal view) to 2 posteriorly laced lateral branchiae with branchiophores exposed and basally fused; two branchial groups separated by a wide gap; styles of branchiae smooth, thin, cylindrical with median pair longest, the lateral pair shorter, of similar length. Notopodia of first and second chaetiger reduced, with second one dorsally displaced; notopodia without cirri. Notochaetae of 2 groups longer, appearing narrowly bilimbate and shorter, simple capillaries. Thoracic uncini with one vertical row of 7 teeth with the second most basal tooth doubled (formula: 1-2-1-1-1-1-1) in frontal view, appearing as 7 teeth above prow. Abdominal uncini with mana small teeth above the main fang, irregularly arranged in multiple rows. Neuropodia free from body wall ventrally. Pygidium with two fleshy, triangular lobes dorsally and ventrally, with smaller lobes laterally; with 2 lateral, medium length cirri.  

Remarks. Currently they are 6 valid species in genus Glyphanostomum, with G. pallescens (Théel, 1879) (type species of this genus) originally described from Arctic (Kara Sea) now considered a cosmopolitan species with wide geographic and bathymetric range.  According to Holthe (1986) type specimen of G. pallescens  has been lost, which probably fuelled its cosmopolitan status and variable description of specimens identified as G. pallescens by different authors from around the world (see for example Holthe, 1986; Hilbig in Blake et al., 2000; Jirkov, 2001; Reusher et al., 2015). Falkland Island specimens are very similar to G. pallescens in number of abdominal chaetigers, with 24-25 reported by Théel (1879) (but see discussion in Reuscher et al., 2015). The main taxonomic characters (see comparative Table used for Glyphanostomum species) are arrangement of branchiae (Reuscher et. al, 2009), form of thoracic uncini and number of abdominal uncinigers. Combination of these characters in Falkland specimens suggests that these may represent a new species. The branchial arrangement which is grouped in 1+2 fashion (the middle branchia is positioned anteriorly to two other pairs and not visible basally as it should be in oblique or transverse row arrangement) is unique among the known Glyphanostomum species so far. Further thoracic uncini are arranged in a single row, but the second basalmost tooth is doubled (Hilbig in Blake, 2000 imaged a similar arraignment in Pacific specimens of G. pallescens). G. scotiarum described from deep waters of Drake Passage, Weddell Sea and South Orkneys possess 33 abdominal uncinigers. In her description of G. scotiarum  Hartman  (1978) did not comment on the form of thoracic uncini in frontal view or detailed the branchial arrangement, which is considered to be in an oblique row (based on her drawing, branchiae appear basally visible and not grouped as in Falkland specimens).

Diagnosis.  Voucher is the only example collected in this study; small, slender specimen, incomplete,  4.1mm long and 0.35mm wide; thorax composed of paleae bearing segment and 17 chaetigers, of which 14 uncinigers; abdomen posteriorly incomplete with only 4 chaetigers present, 1st abdominal unciniger with dorsal foliose lobes. Pygidium unknown.
Prostomium simple, broadly triangular, with short paired nuchal slits, without incision, glandular ridges or eyespots.  Paleae very slender  (about as thin as following notochaetae, gradually tapering to hairlike tips ; very long, surpassing the prostomium.  Four pairs of branchiae, arranged on raised ridge, branchial groups separated by small median gap; styles mostly missing, one apparently regenerating style very thin, smooth, cirriform.
Notopodia with capillary notochaetae, some longer and narrowly limbate capillary chaetae.  Thoracic uncini similar to abdominal uncini with crest of numerous teeth above rostral tooth and basal prow. First abdominal unciniger with dermal fold across dorsum, bearing 4 smooth, foliose lobes with median lobes being larger than lateral ones. Rudimentary notopodia and glandular pads in abdominal uncinigers absent.

Remarks. Tanseimaruana sp. 1 represents a new species of this genus, which currently contains two species -  type species T. vestis (Hartman, 1965) from deep waters off New England, Atlantic Ocean and T. boninensis, from deep waters off Chichijima Island in the Pacific Ocean. As its congeners, FI species shares prostomium without incisions or glandular ridges, with nuchal slits, segment II with paleae, 14 thoracic uncinigers and first abdominal unciniger with 4 dorsal foliose lobes. However it can be distinguished from the other species in arrangement of branchiae, which lie on a raised ridge in FI specimen, but are separated by a large median gap in the other species. However better preserved specimens as well as greater number of specimens are needed in order to fully characterise this species.

Notochaetae few, smooth, narrowly limbate. Thoracic uncini with 5 teeth above rostral tooth and basal prow arranged in a single vertical row; tori without cirri. Abdominal uncinigers very long with rudimentary notopodia.  Abdominal uncini with many small teeth, arranged in 4 regular horizontal rows. Pygidium with 6 short, fleshy, rounded lobes with the 2 dorsal ones largest and 2 ventral ones smallest.

Remarks. Characters of taxonomic importance in genus Samythella are summarised in remarks section of another species encountered in this study as Samythella sp. 1.  The two FI species (each represented by one specimen only) are very similar, differing primarily in size and number of abdominal uncinigers. Samythella sp. 1 represents a larger species with 27 abdominal uncinigers and indistinct (but upon staining detectable dorsal ridge between thoracic chaetigers 3 and 4), while Samtyhella sp. 2 possess only 17 abdominal uncinigers and no ridge has been detected. The two species also differ in a form of abdominal uncini, in lateral view, the basal prow appears quadrate  in Samythella sp.1  and rounded in Samythella sp. 2 (see Plates for each species).  Samythella sp. 2 represents a new species, given the combination of characters such as number abdominal uncinigers and number and form and ventral cirri (see comparative table for known species of Samythella).

The presence of dorsal crest also suggest affiliation with genera Melinnampharete Annenkova, 1937 and Eusamythella Hartman, 1971 (Eusamythella is considered a synonym of Melinnampharete by Jirkov, 2011), but within this group, FI specimen would also represent a new species given its much higher number of abdominal uncinigers, lack of paleae and the presence of rudimentary notopodia in abdomen. The generic placement of FI specimen is clearly tentative at present. Greater number of specimens is desirable in order to formally describe this species. Further, another species placed in this genus Samythella sp. 2 has been encountered in this study (see Remarks section for Samythella sp. 2 and comparative table below).

Voucher. Toroa: station T10FB

Diagnosis.  Voucher is the only specimen collected in this study; a complete specimen, robust, thorax inflated, abdomen tapering; dark yellow to pale orange in alcohol; length 15mm, width 1.5mm (at widest point of the thorax); thorax composed of 17 chaetigers, of these 14 uncinigers, with conspicuous ventral shields in 5-6 thoracic uncinigers; abdomen with 11 uncinigers. Anterior notopodia well developed, increasing in size from first to third pair; second notopodia dorsally shifted; notopodia without cirri. Abdominal uncinigers, without rudimentary notopodia; 1st  reduced in size, others developed into typical ampharetid pinnules.

Prostomium with large, square-shaped middle lobe encircled by surrounding lobe; prostomium without glandular ridges or eyespots. Lower lip forms a high collar-like structure, with many wide and shallow crenulations on anterior margin. Paleae absent. Tips of buccal tentacles exposed, smooth, somewhat distally flattened and inflated, with dark orange pigments. Three pairs of  branchiae, grouped, ceratophores forming a ridge, with one placed posteriorly to other two; two separated by small median gap; branchial style mostly missing, only one still attached cylindrical, inflated, annulated, with dark yellow to orange pigmentation.

Notochaetae few, arranged in longer and shorter row, narrowly limbate. Thoracic uncini with 5 teeth above rostral tooth and basal prow (appear to be arranged in a single or two vertical rows), tori without cirri. Abdominal uncini with 4 teeth in 3 alternating vertical rows over rostral tooth and basal prow.
Pygidium without any cirri.

Remarks. Falkland specimen likely represents a new species. Ehlers (1913) described S. speculatrix  from Kaiser Wilhelm II Land, Southern Ocean, depth 350m as having 12 abdominal unciniger and pigmented eyespots. Other valid species in genus Samytha can be differentiated by number of abdominal uncinigers (AUs): S. californiensis Hartman 1969 with 16/20 AUs, S. gurjanovae Uschakov, 1950 with 19 AUs, S. hesslei Caullery, 1944 with 25/26 AUs,  S. sexcirrata (Sars, 1856) with 13 AUs, and S. annenkovae with 15 AUs.  Only S. storchi Reuscher and Wehe, 2009 has 11 AUs this is however a shallow water species described from the Red Sea which differs from other known species, including FI specimens  in having branchiophores all fused and located on the first chaetiger, without a gap.

Voucher. VINSTON WEST: station 2MFA.
Diagnosis.  Voucher is the only example of this species collected in this study; specimen incomplete, damaged; anterior fragment 9mm long and 0.8mm wide (at the widest part of thorax). Single pair of emergent postbranchial hooks present, but tips broken off.  Eighteen thoracic chaetigers, 14 of these uncinigers. Pygidium unknown.
Prostomium is a large square shaped lobe, anteriorly with side shallow depression; with two prominent patches of many golden brown eyespots. Dorsum of chaetiger 4 with a narrow membranous fold with serrated free margin, with 10 blunt, sub-triangular serrations of similar size.
Two groups of branchiae, basally fused; each group with four distally tapering cylindrical branchiae.
Thoracic uncini in frontal view with 3 teeth in a single row plus 2 smaller teeth distally (formula: 1-1-1-2); abdominal uncini in lateral view with 4 teeth, uncinus quadreate with a small constriction above prow.
Tube: small fragment of tube present, thin layer of mud, heavily encrusted with small particles.
Remarks. Falkland Island specimens from shallower depth agreed well with Melinna arnaudi Parapar and San Martín (1997), however this specimen clearly represent a different species. It differs from M. arnaudi by presence of eyes, shape of prostomium, form of tube and form of thoracic uncini (these are arranged in a single row, without any teeth which are doubled in M. arnaudi). Given the rather poor condition of the specimen and the fact that Melinna species from the area were often lumped under the northern European M. cristata, it would be desirable to collect a larger number of well-preserved specimens and carry out a revision of this genus in the region.

Diagnosis. Voucher is a complete specimen (branchiae missing), body relatively slender 14mm long and 1.2mm wide. Thorax consists of paleae bearing segment and 16 chaetigers, 13 of these uncinigers; abdomen with 12 uncinigers.  First three notopodia smaller than on subsequent segments, close together, second and third pair displaced dorsally.

Lower lip crenulated with approximately 15 folds.  Paleae present, arising from cylindrical lobes, about 10 per fascicle, pale yellow in colour, very fine, small  (can be overlooked), slightly shorter than notochaetae, tapering into thin tip; under high magnification two types can be discerned, slightly thicker, narrowly limbate capillaries and simple threadlike capillaries.  
Four pairs of branchiae 2 + 2 arrangement, two groups separated by a distinct median gap; styles of branchiae missing,  branchiophores of equal size, connected laterally giving impression of raised ridge and obscuring prostomium dorsally.
Notochaetae few, long, smooth, limbate. Thoracic uncini with 4-5 small teeth above rostral tooth arranged in two alternating vertical rows; first two abdominal neuropodia of thoracic type; following abdominal neuropodia with different uncini, each with 5 teeth in lateral view, forming paw pattern in frontal view.
Remarks. Only two species in the genus Lysippe have been described with 17 thoracic chaetigers (including paleae), 13 thoracic uncinigers and cirriform branchiae (character which cannot be confirmed in FI specimen) - the type species L. labiata from Northern Europe (Spitzbergen) and L. nipponica from Nagasaki Bay, Japan in 50m. Both of these appear to differ from FI specimen in form of thoracic and/or abdominal uncini and it is likely that these represent a new species. However careful examination of type specimens will be necessary to confirm this.

Diagnosis. Voucher is a complete specimen (branchial styles missing), body slender 10mm long and 0.6mm wide. Thorax consists of paleae bearing segment and 17 chaetigers, 14 of these uncinigers; abdomen with 8 uncinigers.  First three notopodia smaller than on subsequent segments, close together, second and third pair displaced dorsally.  Abdominal segments without rudimental notopodia or neuropodial cirri.

Prostomium  Ampharete-type, trilobed  - the middle lobe large square-shaped only slightly wider than lateral lobes, with large blotches composed of small pigmented dots. Lower lip well developed, forming high membrane, only very weakly crenulated on anterior margin, with approximately 5 large folds.  Paleae present, arising from cylindrical lobes, pale yellow in colour, very fine, small  (can be overlooked), slightly shorter than notochaetae, tapering into thin tip.
Four pairs of branchiae in 3 + 1 arrangement, two groups of branchiae separated by a small median gap; styles of branchiae missing; branchiophores connected laterally giving impression of raised ridge.
Notochaetae few, long, smooth, limbate. Thoracic and abdominal uncini similar, with many small teeth above rostral tooth forming paw pattern in frontal view.
Remarks. Several ampharetid genera with 14 thoracic uncinigers were synonymised with genus Lysippe Malmgren, 1866 by Jirkov (2011). This synonymy included genus Lysippides Hessle, 1917  in which  Wollebaeck (1912) placed species Lyssipides fragilis, which he described form Northern Europe. Falkland Island specimens agree well with this Northern European species in many characters - shape of prostomium, presence of pigmentation on prostomium, branchial arrangement, form of paleae and uncini, number of thoracic chaetigers and uncinigers, as well as possessing 8 abdominal uncinigers. The only difference is in the form of pygidium, which has two lateral cirri in L. fragilis, but it is only composed of several short lobes in FI specimen. However only one example of this species was collected from Falkland Islands and it is possible that pygidial cirri are missing. Until further evidence becomes available, we suggest the use of cf. when identifying this species.

Diagnosis. Voucher is a complete specimen, 14mm long and 0.6mm wide. Thorax consists of paleae bearing segment and 15 chaetigers, 12 of these uncinigers; abdomen with 12 uncinigers.  Thorax divided into two regions: (1) anterior thoracic chaetigers (chaetigers 1-9) short (first two particularly crowded) with well developed ventral glandular pads, using Shirla-stain, bands on ventrum of these chaetigers particularly strong in uncinigers 1 and 2; chaetiger 10 transitory between two regions; (2) posterior thoracic chaetigers (=last 5) very long, glandular pads not developed.  First and second notopodia smaller than on subsequent segments, close together, first pair in particular obscured by segment with paleae and branchial ridge. Abdominal segments without rudimental notopodia or neuropodial cirri. Pygidium formed of two small lobes.
Prostomium  Ampharete-type, trilobed (appear as a single triangular lobe), without glandular ridges. Lower lip crenulated.  Paleae present, arising from large cylindrical lobes, about 10 per fascicle, pale yellow in colour, very slender,  long (reaching the anterior end of prostomium), tapering into thin tips. Three pairs of branchiae arranged in one row, two groups separated by a narrow median gap; styles of branchiae mostly missing, only two still attached in voucher, these are smooth, long, slender and cylindrical; all branchiophores of equal size, connected laterally giving impression of raised ridge, long - obscuring prostomium dorsally.
Notochaetae few, long, smooth, narrowly limbate. Thoracic uncini with 6 small teeth above rostral tooth arranged in two alternating vertical rows; first two abdominal neuropodia of thoracic type; following abdominal neuropodia with different uncini, each with 5 teeth in lateral view, forming paw pattern in frontal view.
Remarks. Falkland Island specimens are most similar to Northern European species Eclysippe vanelli (Fauvel, 1936), which has been widely reported, but it appears there are some inconsistencies particularly in the form of abdominal uncini. Jirkov (2011) commented that Eclysippe belongs to a group of ampharetid genera where the first two abdominal uncinigers are of thoracic type. Holthe (1986) and Jirkov (2001) used drawings taken from Eliason (1955) to show abdominal uncini of different type to thoracic ones, however Aguirrezabalaga and Parapar (2014) reported abdominal uncini (posterior to abdominal uncinigers 1 and 2) similar to thoracic ones. The shape of posterior abdominal uncini is markedly different from those in thorax in Falkland Island specimens and different from those figured by Eliason (1955). Paleae also appear to be much longer in FI specimens than those in E. vanelli. We suggest that FI specimens probably represent a new species, however further work would be necessary to examine specimens of Eclysippe vanelli from other geographical location and most importantly, the type specimen of Fauvel (1936). The other two currently recognised species of Eclysippe are different from FI specimens.  Eclysippe eliasoni (Day, 1973) has 13-14 abdominal segments,  notopodia 1 and 2 well spaced  and not protruding from large cylindrical lobes (based on drawing provided by Day, 1973), type locality Beaufort, North Carolina in 200 m (see notes about the status of this species in WoRMS database). Pacific species Eclysippe trilobata (Hartman, 1969) differs in body shape without extreme lengthening of the thorax  (ch. 1-6 shorter, separated ventrally by a deep furrow, rest of the thorax with slightly longer chaetigers, based on re-description by Hilbig, 2000), paleae are stouter and abdominal uncini described as similar to thoracic ones.

Thorax consists of paleae bearing segment and 14 chaetigers, 12 of these uncinigers; abdomen with 13 uncinigers.  Prostomium  Ampharete-type, trilobed, without glandular ridges.  Paleae present, about 15 per fascicle, longer than most developed notochaetae, slender, gradually tapering into long, thin tip. Four pairs of branchiae in 3 + 1 arrangement; three anterior pairs are arranged in a row on a raised ridge, the 4th pair is stand alone, located posterior at the level of notopodia of thoracic chaetiger 2 (the chaetiger following paleae bearing segment); styles of branchiae mostly missing, where present these are long and smooth, cylindrical; branchiophores of  3 anterior pairs of equal size, branchiophore of posterior pairs, smaller, low (can be overlooked). Whitish, circular band  anterior to notopodia of TU-3 (stains strongly red using Shirla stain), additionally stain shows ventral only bands on TU-1 and TU-2. First and second notopodia smaller than in subsequent chaetigers, but not reduced. The modified notopodia on TU-8 slightly shifted dorsally and  connected with low glandular ridge. Notochaetae in two rows throughout the thorax, one row consist of 6-7 long, smooth, narrowly limbate capillaries and second row consists of similar, but shorted chaetae; in modified notopodia of TU-8 limbate notochaetae wider, abruptly tapering into slender tip distally (their surface may appear hirsute under high magnification). Abdominal segments without rudimental notopodia or neuropodial cirri. Pygidium a short, wide cone, dorsally slightly enlarged, no cirri observed.
Remarks. Genus Anobothrus has been a subject of recent reviews worldwide (Jirkov, 2008) and regionally concentrating on Southern Ocean and South American waters (Schüller and Jirkov, 2013), with some new species discovered in the process, many of those from deep waters. Characters of those species are summarized in Table accompanying this description. Of the 4 known species of Anobothrus known from the region, which have circular band anterior to TU-3, Falkland specimens agree with A. glandularis, although they differ in number of abdominal segments (12 in A. glandularis, 13 in Falkland specimens), but this character can show variation in other Anobothrus species (see Jirkov, 2011) and position of the posterior 4th branchiophore. Until the examination of type specimens of A. glandularis is possible to confirm the identity of Falkland specimens, we prefer to assign the name Anobothrus cf. glandularis at this stage.

Four pairs of cirriform branchiae in 2 transverse rows in segments III and IV (forming 2+2 square arrangement), separated by a median gap; branchial styles mostly missing, only 2 present in voucher (on left hand side), both smooth, cylindrical to somewhat flattened (but not truly lamellate), with horizontal striation throughout their length, tapering into blunt tip.
Notochaetae arranged in two groups about 4-5 long, limbate, smooth capillaries with thin tips and similar but much shorter ones. Neuropodial tori with uncini, first and second torus particularly enlarged and producing into short tips dorsally and ventrally, housing around 100 uncini, tori of subsequent uncinigers getting smaller, rounded, posterior thoracic tori housing around 50 uncini. Both thoracic and abdominal uncini with 5 teeth over basal prow in lateral view (although in frontal view some teeth are doubled), rostral tooth not observed. Pygidium with terminal anus and two lateral cirri.

Remarks. Falkland Island specimens are here asigned to the genus Amphicteis, although the longitudinal ridges on prostomium were not observed. The other Amphicteis-like genera  - Phyllamphicteis Augener, 1918 (two of four pairs of branchiae lamellate, Paramphicteis Caullery, 1944 (no paleae) and Pseudoamphicteis Hutchings, 1977 (papillose buccal tentacles) are junior synonyms of Amphicteis according to Jirkov (2001). Genus Jugamphicteis Fauchald & Hancock, 1981 lacks longitudinal ridges, but it is also characterised by the presence of fan-like extension on first abdominal segment, which is absent in Falklands specimens.
Amphicteis chilensis Hartmann-Schröder, 1965 is very similar to Falkland Island specimens, but not all characters (such as shape of branchiae) can be varifed as these are missing in all Falkland Island specimen other than voucher, in which only two branchiae are present, others are missing, further not all characters mentioned here were imaged or described by  Hartmann-Schröder, 1965. The most noticable difference is in the shape of anterior marging of prostomium, this is concave (with wide shallow depression, forming short anterolateral horns) in FI specimens, while in A. chilensis appears to be convex from the shallow mid depression (Hartmann-Schröder, 1965: p. 247, Fig. 245), dorsum is smooth not annulated as in A. chilensis and additionally rostral tooth in uncini were not observed in Falkland Island specimens and dorsal cirrus in abdominal notopodia is longer. It is probable that Falkland Island specimens represent a new species.

Voucher. LOLIGO station: L3FB
Diagnosis.  Voucher specimen is the only example of this species collected; specimen complete (branchial styles missing), small but robust species with enlarged thorax, tapering posteriorly, 5.5mm long and 0.6mm wide; colour in alcohol pale yellow. Thorax composed of paleae bearing segment and 14 thoracic chaetigers, of which 12 uncinigers; abdomen with 13 uncinigers. Prostomium  trilobed, with large square-shaped middle lobe delimited by incision from lateral lobes, without glandular ridges or eyes. Buccal tentacles papillose. Paleae present; few (often broken off), long (reaching the anterior margin of prostomium), stout, narrowing rapidly into very long thing tips; yellow in colour. Four pairs of branchiae (all styles missing); 3 pairs of branchiae arranged in transverse line, separated by wide median gap, 4th pair shifted posteriorly, tightly attached between 2nd outermost and innermost branchiae of transverse row. Notopodia with limbate capillary notochaetae. Thoracic uncini with 6 teeth in 2 vertical rows over basal prow and rostral tooth; thoracic uncini of the last two thoracic unciniger resembling those of abdomen. Abdominal uncini small, with several rows of small teeth. First 5 abdominal uncinigers with dorsal cirri, cirrus of 1st AU small globular, of AUs 2-5 distinct, digiform.  Pygidium with several irregular small lobes and a pair of prominent, medium length lateral cirri.
Remarks. Genus Ampharete sensu Jirkov (2001, 2009, 2011) includes species with or without paleae, with four pairs of smooth branchiae, papillose buccal tentacles, 13/14 thoracic chaetigers (excluding paleae) provided with notochaetae and 11/12 thoracic uncinigers.  Species most similar to FI specimen (4 pairs of branchiae, paleae bearing segment plus 14 thoracic chaetigers, of which 12 uncinigers and 13 abdominal uncinigers) are relatively few in this otherwise species rich genus and none are known from the geographical area considered here. This group contains boreal species A. finmarchica and A. acutifrons (Atlantic and Pacific forms likely represent different species; see Hilbig in Blake et al. 1996) which both possess rudimental notopodia in anterior abdominal segments and A. finmarchica also lacks gap between the branchial groups. In FI species rudimental notopodia are absent, but distinct globular to digiform dorsal cirrus is present in neuropodia of AU 1-5.  The commonly reported Southern Ocean species Ampharete kerguelensis has branchiae inserted all in 1 row, rather than in 3 + 1 arrangement and has only 12 abdominal uncinigers. Ampharete labrops from shallow waters of California is also similar, but its upper lip has a band of eyespots. Falkland Island specimens likely represent a new species, but greater number of specimens is desirable in order to provide a full description of this species.

(2009) was used to determine generic identifications (different taxonomic source may lead to different idenitifications). For simplicity, all posterior body segments bearing uncini, but lacking notopodia and/or notochaetae are considered abdominal uncinigers (in contrast, Imajima et al. (2012) suggested that segments which lack notopodia but have neuropodia shaped as in thoracic uncinigers are considered intermediate uncinigers and excluded from the count of abdominal uncinigers).

Genus Sternaspis Otto, 1821
Sternaspis sp. 1
Voucher specimens. Sea Lion: Stations 90MFB (2 adults) and 22 MFC (adults and subadults).
Diagnosis.  Small species (relative to other species of Sternaspidae); voucher complete specimens (adults), 9 mm long,  3 mm wide (at widest part of abdomen), 31  segments introvert exposed . Body colour in alcohol light brown to greyish. The body has narrow introvert, with bulbous head of 2:3 width ratio to widest part of abdomen and very narrow waist segments (the narrowest part of the body) at 1:3 width ratio to the widest part of the abdomen. Cuticular papillae evenly distributed over most of the body (can be eroded in larger specimens) especially obvious at narrowest part of the introvert.
Prostomium hemispherical, opalescent, without eyespots. Peristomium rounded, without papillae. Mouth slightly oval, completely covered by papillae. First three chaetigers with 8-13 bronze, widely separated, slightly falcate hooks per ramus, with subdistal dark areas, transparent in juveniles, opaque in larger specimens, with thin arista-like spine distally (often broken off). Genital papillae protrude ventrally from intersegmental groove between segments 7 and 8.
Ventro-caudal shield  orange in juveniles, darker orange to light brown in adults; ribbed, often covered by sediment; concentric bands not obvious; anterior margins rounded; deep suture running through the shield; lateral margins straight in smaller specimens, curved in larger specimens, expanding posteriorly. Fan projecting beyond posterior corners, smooth, with a well-developed median notch .
Marginal chaetae fascicles include 10 lateral ones in an oval arrangement, and 67 posterior fascicles arranged in an approximately ventro-dorsal line. Lateral chaetae are longest in their most posterior position; light bronze proximally along the shafts, grading to almost clear at the distal ends; the posteriomost lateral 3-4 fascicles overlap with the short posterior chaetae, but clearly set behind these, the last lateral fascicle often present as only one or few chaetae and can be easily overlooked. Posterior chaeatal fascicle short, getting progressively longer toward the outer margin of the shield.
Branchiae stout, coiled, protruding from two oval, obliquely set plates, one on either side of anus. Many long filamentous interbranchial papillae with sediment particles attached.

Remarks. FI specimens superficially agree well with S. fossor (considered to have a distribution limited to North American Atlantic coast) in body colour, shape of caudal shield (including sediment encrustation), papillation, possession of 10 lateral shield chaetae and 6-7 posterior chaetae (this number is fixed in other species, not variable). FI specimens differ in not having obvious concentric lines in their shield unlike the S. fossor. Additionally, the two species possess different body shapes with S. fossor generally having a very thick introvert, while it is thin in FI specimens. The body shape has not been really assessed as taxonomic character so far, but given examination of several other species (see below), we suggest that there is consistency to the body shape, which varies among the species.
Sternaspis had been recorded from Southern Ocean and South America by previous authors (see reference in Sendall and Salazar-Vallejo 2013) and commonly assigned to species S. scutata (possessing 6 posterior shield chaetae). None of these authors gave a detailed description of their specimens, as given the distinctive shape of Sternaspidae, they have assumed that their material belongs to a few or even one species most notably S. scutata. Recent revision work by Sendall and Salazar-Vallejo (2013) showed this assumption to be incorrect and restricted the distribution of S. scutata to Mediterranean and Northeastern Atlantic, eventually leading to a description of two new species from the Southern Ocean S. monroi and S. sendalli (Salazar-Vallejo, 2014). Type specimens of S. monroi and S. sendalli  were elected from the historical collection held at NHM London and were re-examined in here. The differences between two known species from the Southern Ocean and new FI species are summarized in table below.

Voucher. Sea Lion: Station 79MFC.
Diagnosis. Voucher complete specimen (branchial crown missing); body length 6mm; width at fourth chaetiger level 0.3mm; body very narrow, cylindrical, thread-like; preserved specimens pale yellow. Body with eight thoracic and three abdominal chaetigers; chaetiger 12 shortest about as wide as long; chaetiger 38 much longer than wide, increasing in length posteriorly; chaetiger 9 slightly shorter than 8; remaining abdominal chaetigers successively shorter, chaetiger 11 wider than long.
Branchial crown missing.  Peristomium with anterior margin of anterior peristomial ring as a low ridge of even height all around, incomplete middorsally not overlapping the higher middorsal conical lobe.  Anterior peristomial ring about as long as wide, ventrally with a large square-shaped pad; peristomial eyes not observed (possibly with a pair of very faint black eyes?).
Collar chaetae as very narrowly hooded capillaries; superior thoracic notochaetae elongate, narrowly hooded, around 5-8 per fascicle; inferior thoracic notochaetae of chaetiger 38 bearing up to 3 pseudospatulate chaetae. Thoracic uncini acicular; 8-9 per fascicle arranged in a single irregular row; dark yellow to light brown in colour with large secondary tooth oblique to main fang; apical teeth slender and slightly decreasing in size towards tip of uncinus; small hood present .
Abdominal neuropodia with few very elongated, narrowly hooded chaetae. Abdominal uncini with about 10 rows of teeth in profile, 5 teeth per row; manubrium about the same length as dentate region, slightly expanded proximally; number of uncini per fascicle slightly decreasing posteriorly to 10 on chaetiger 11.
Pygidium conical, longer than chaetiger 11, pygidial eyes not observed .
Remarks. Even though the branchial crown is missing, the characters consistent with genus Fabricinuda Fitzhugh, 1990 were observed, collar present as a low ridge all around, pseudospatulate chaetae present in chaetigers 3-8. This is a second species of Fabricinuda reported from FI material as well as from wider geographical area (Southern Ocean, Magellan region). It differs from Fabricinuda sp. 1 reported from Falkland Islands  in possessing a well-developed collar, lack of peristomial eyes (faint at best if present), lack of pygidial eyes and the presence of square-shaped pad on the ventrum of anterior peristomial collar (this character is unique and has not been reported in any other Fabricinuda species).  This is only the fourth species of Fabriciidae recorded from the Southern Ocean/Magellan region, yet two new species were found from a single sampling effort, suggesting that improved sampling is likely to discover more of these small, thin bodied worms.

Voucher specimens. Sea Lion: Stations 1MFC, 1MFA, 49MFA.
Diagnosis. Voucher complete specimen; body length 9mm plus 3mm for branchial crown; width at fourth chaetiger level 0.25mm; body very narrow, cylindrical, thread-like; preserved specimens white to pale yellow. Tube present in some specimens , loose (easily broken down), muddy with some particles incorporated. All specimens with eight thoracic and three abdominal chaetigers ; chaetigers 12 shortest about as wide than long; chaetigers 38 much longer than wide, increasing length posteriorly; chaetiger 9 slightly shorter than 8; remaining abdominal chaetigers successively shorter, chaetiger 11 wider than long.
Branchial crown (missing in majority of examined specimens) present in voucher; with three pairs of radioles; distal ends filamentous. Dorsal lips and ventral lips not confirmed under stereomicroscope observation. Vascularized ventral filamentous appendages absent. Branchial hearts present .
Peristomium with 1- 2 pairs of black, crescentic eyes;  narrow and long dorsal median lobe; ventral lobe smaller (less than ½ of dorsal lobe), anterior margin of anterior peristomial ring as a low ridge of even height ventrally, markedly notched laterally rounded lobe to either side of dorsal midline, not overlapping the higher middorsal conical lobe .

Collar chaetae - few narrow hooded chaetae; superior thoracic notochaetae elongate, narrowly hooded, around 5-8 per fascicle; inferior thoracic notochaetae of chaetigers 38 bearing 3 pseudospatulate chaetae . Thoracic uncini acicular; 78 per fascicle arranged in double rows in chaetigers 1-4  in voucher specimen (in other specimens forming a single irregular row), from chaetigers 5 blending into single, if irregular row ; dark yellow to light brown in colour with large secondary tooth oblique to main fang ; apical teeth slender and slightly decreasing in size towards tip of uncinus; small hood present.
Abdominal neuropodia with few very elongate, narrowly hooded chaetae.
Abdominal uncini with about 10 rows of teeth in profile, 4-5 teeth per row; manubrium about the same length as dentate region, slightly expanded proximally; number of uncini per fascicle slightly decreasing posteriorly.
Pygidium conical, longer than chaetiger 11, with pair of black pygidial eyes situated in posterior fourth of pygidium.
Remarks. This is only third species of family Fabriciidae from the Southern Ocean or Magellan region. The other two known species Novofabricia chilensis Hartmann-Shroder, 1962 from Chile and Raficiba barryi Fitzhugh, 2001 from Antarctica belong to different genera because of the structure of anterior ventral collar as well as other characters (see Fitzhugh 2001, Huang et al. 2011 for details).  The reduced collar all around combined with the presence of inferior pseudospatulate chaetae in chaetigers 3-7/ 8 place FI specimens into genus Fabricinuda Fitzugh, 1990.  However some characters linked to branchial crown such dorsal and ventral lips are currently not confirmed. This is a first record of genus Fabricinuda from the geographic area investigated here and likely represent a new species. Of the known species (see Fitzhugh 1990, Fitzhugh 2002, Lopez and Rodríguez 2008), FI species is similar to Fabricinuda pseudopalpa Fitzhugh, 1990 and F. longilabrum Fitzhugh, 2002 in lacking ventral filamentous appendages. Fabricinuda longilabrum can be further distinguished  from FI species by having the anterior peristomial ring distinctly longer than wide and  F. pseudopalpa can be distinguished by possessing middorsal lobes which can range from small and lobe-like to elongate and palp-like and the anterior end of the body being light to dark brown. The other five described species of the genus, F. limnicola, F. bikinii (Hartman, 1954), F. trilobata (Fitzhugh, 1983), F. pseudocollaris Fitzhugh, 1990 and F. rosaelenae López & Rodríguez, 2008 can be readily distinguished by having unbranched, vascularized ventral filamentous appendages in their branchial crowns and lack of dorsal lips.

Laonice sp. 3
Voucher. Endeavour: Station E10FB
Diagnosis. Voucher is the only specimen collected in this study; incomplete, short anterior fragment of 26 chaetigers, 6 mm long and 1 mm wide. Anterior part of body enlarged and flattened; colour in alcohol off white to yellow.
Prostomium narrow, anteriorly rounded; indistinctly fused with peristomium by a thin membrane (peristomial lateral wings not rising above prostomium); eyes present as 4 rudimentary, red blotches; occipital antenna missing (absent?) caruncle posteriorly indistinct.
Branchiae from chaetiger 2, missing in most segments, where present superseding the length of corresponding notopodial postchaetal lamella to which basally fused; exact number of branchiae not defined, since all the specimens are incomplete.
Chaetiger 1 with triangular, short notopodial postchaetal lamellae and rounded neuropodial lamellae; notopodial postchaetal lamellae increasingly larger, triangular with short blunt tip, observed until the end of fragment, where they decrease in size. Dorsal crests not observed. Neuropodial pouches present from chaetiger 15, well developed.
Notopodial and neuropodial chaetae smooth, narrowly limbate capillaries; always arranged in 2 rows in both noto- and neuropodia. Sabre chaetae, granulated throughout most of its length present from chaetiger 18, up to 3 per fascicle. Neuropodial hooded hooks not observed in 26 chaetiger long fragment. Pygidium missing, not observed.
Remarks. The diagnosis above is based on an incomplete single specimen, therefore full set of characters as well as inter-specific variation cannot be reported. Summary of the characters distinguishing different Laonice species from Falkland Island and wider region can be found in the page Laonice species comparison table.

Voucher. Sea  Lion: Station 38MFC
Diagnosis. Voucher is the only specimen collected in this study. Incomplete, small and slender specimen with 20 chaetigers, 2.2mm long and 0.15mm wide.
Prostomium anteriorly rounded, posteriorly extending to the end of chaetiger 1 as a short, blunt caruncle; eyes absent. Peristomium partially fused to chaetiger 1, not pronounced into lateral wings. Branchiae all missing, but small stumps (now lost) initially observed at least on chaetigers 2 and 3 (on one side only). Notopodial lamellae largest on chaetigers 2-4, triangular to leaf shaped with dorsal tip most pronounced in lamellae of chaetiger 3 and 4; corresponding neuropodial lamellae also largest in comparison to other chaetigers, oval. Very prominent dorsal crests in chaetigers 5-7, less prominent dorsal crests continue to chaetiger 12. Single, stout, granulated at the tip, sabre chaeta present in neuropodia from chaetiger 9; multidentate (main fang plus 4 smaller teeth observed in lateral view) hooded hooks present from chaetiger 10, up to 4 per fascicle; notopodial hooks not observed in 20 chaetigers long fragment; other chaetae capillaries. Pygidium unknown.
Remarks. The presence of small branchial stumps (initially observed at least on chaetigers 2 and 3, but now lost due to damage during the examination), the shape of prostomium and the form and distribution of neuropodial hooded hooks make this specimen consistent with genus Prionospio Malmgren, 1867. The distribution and form of branchiae is an important diagnostic character in this genus therefore a better specimen, with full branchial set is needed to fully diagnose this species. The particularly prominent dorsal crests on chaetigers 5-7 make this species easily recognisable from other spionid species collected from Falkland Islands.

Voucher specimens. Sea Lion: Stations 11MFB, 22MFA and 26MFC.
Diagnosis. Vouchers are the only examples of this species collected in this study. First voucher in bad condition, consisting of 17 chaetigers only; fragment is wide, flattened, measuring 3mm long and 1.2mm wide.
Prostomium is Scolelepis-like narrow, long, pointed - anteriorly produced into thin cirrus-like extension; posteriorly extending into two short loops; occipital antenna not observed (however a small scar at base of prostomium suggests it may be present); eyes not observed. Neuropodial hooded hooks appear from chaetiger 13 as single unidentate spine assuming fully developed bi-dentate form by chaetigers 15, two teeth well separated, with main fang at least twice the length of the secondary tooth, large round hood present; 5 per fascicle.
Vouchers 22 MFA and 26MFC better preserved, incomplete specimen, 4.5mm long and 1.5-1.8mm wide for 18 and 19 chaetigers.
Prostomium same as in first voucher, occipital antenna clearly present (in voucher 22MFA), presence of notochaetae in first chaetigers confirmed. Additionally, branchiae can be observed fully fused to notopodial lamellae except for the most distal end in chaetigers 2 and 3, becoming more distinguishable from chaetiger 4. Margin of notopodial lamellae crenulated (lamellae in folds). Neuropodial lamellae well developed on all chaetigers (smallest on chaetiger 1) as a semi-oval lobe. Neuropodial hooded hooks appear from chaetiger 15. The rest of the body unknown.
Remarks. Although only incomplete diagnosis could be given based on 3 (one of them rather damaged) specimens, the characters observed are enough to conclude that FI specimen constitutes a different species form Scolelepis currently known from the region (see Table 1. for summary). The species most similar to FI specimens is Scolelepis eltaninae Blake, 1983  in abruptly narrowing extension of anterior prostomial margin, possessing the occipital antenna and notochaetae in first chaetiger. The two species clearly differ in distribution and form on neuropodial hooded hooks (see Table 1 for details). The FI specimen very likely represent a new species and will be formally described.

Voucher specimens. Sea Lion: Stations 28 MFC and 32MFC large, adult specimen; Station 20MFB example of juvenile
Diagnosis. Vouchers incomplete specimens with 23-24 chaetigers, 0.8 mm wide and 4.3-6 mm long (adults). Prostomium bell-shaped, with short anterolateral horns in adult; in juveniles prostomial shape more variable anteriorly rounded to triangular with anterolateral horns less to well developed. Occipital antenna present, large, ciriform. Eyes absent. Dorsal ciliated organs present as two mediolateral lines extending to about chaetigers 14-15 (often indistinct). Peristomium poorly to moderately developed.
Chaetigers 14 with long cirriform to triangular notopodial postchaetal lamellae. Chaetal spreader 0+1 type (see Meißner (2005) for definition) with semicircular glandular opening well developed in chaetigers 57. Ventrolateral intersegmental pouches present from between chaetigers 15-16 (in some juveniles the pouches can appear slightly later in between chaetigers 17-18). Dorsal ciliated crests distinct from about chaetigers 17-18, well developed from about chaetiger 20.
Chaetae of 4 types: capillaries (simple and narrowly limbate); single stout, crook-like chaeta in the neuropodium of chaetiger 1; ventral, granulated at tip sabre chaetae from chaetiger 4; 5-6 neuropodial hooks without hoods from chaetiger 15. Pygidium unknown.
Remarks. The specimens collected from Falkland Islands agree well with the description of S. algidus, which also has sub-Antarctic distribution (known from near Crozet Island) in possessing bell-shaped prostomia with an occipital antenna, long dorsal ciliated organs and intersegmental ventrolateral pouches from segment 15 to 16. The Falkland Island specimens differ in the lack of observable pigmentation noted in S. algidus by Meißner (2005).  A large number of small specimens has been collected during the 2012 survey. Given the size of these specimens and the fact that these agree well with the description above (see note on the start of pouches above), the conclusion was made that these represent a juvenile stage of S. algidus. Meißner (2005) remarked that S. algidus is most similar to S. kroyeri, whose distribution has been restricted to Northern Europe. Previous faunistic studies recorded S. kroyeri from Falkland Islands (e.g. Blake 1983), but it is likely that these records belong in fact to S. algidus.
Distribution. Southern Ocean (Crozet Island), Falkland Islands.

Voucher. Inflex: Station 5MFB
Diagnosis. Voucher is the only specimen collected in this study; incomplete, 28 mm long, 2.2 mm wide for 56 chaetigers (voucher is damaged in the region from chaetiger 25-50). Anterior part of body enlarged and flattened; colour in alcohol off white to yellow.
Prostomium narrow, anteriorly rounded; indistinctly fused with peristomium by a thin membrane (peristomial lateral wings not rising above prostomium); one pair of rudimentary red eyes; occipital antenna present, very short, triangular; caruncle long, continuing posteriorly to chaetiger 12.
Branchiae from chaetiger 2, small, cirriform at first increasing in length and thickness in subsequent chaetigers, fused to notopodial postchaetal lamella basally; of similar length to corresponding lamellae, exact number of branchiae impossible to define, since all the specimens incomplete.
Chaetiger 1 with triangular, short notopodial postchaetal lamellae and rounded neuropodial lamellae; notopodial postchaetal lamellae increasingly large up to chaetiger 5 then remaining of similar size, triangular and acutely pointed in notopodia until the end of fragment (where observed, damaged in chaetigers 25-50). Dorsal crests not observed. Neuropodial pouches present from chaetiger 16, well developed.
Notopodial capillaries of 2 types: long, smooth narrowly limbate and more numerous shorter ones, distally coarsely hirsute with smooth tips. Neuropodial neurochaetae also distally densely hirsute; hirstuation less pronounced in the anterior chaetigers. Capillaries always arranged in 2 rows in both noto- and neuropodia. Sabre chaetae, granulated throughout most of its length present from chaetiger 17, 1-2 per fascicle. Neuropodial hooded hooks present from chaetiger 34, 10 per fascicle; hooks bidentate (in lateral view) with main fang surmounted by a smaller apical tooth by a relatively narrow gap; hood robust, anteriorly truncated; shaft stout and finely striated.
Pygidium missing.
Remarks. Distinct hirstuation of capillaries is an uncommon feature in Spionidae and has not been reported in any species of Laonice to our knowledge. The diagnosis above is based on single specimen, therefore inter-specific variety of certain characters cannot be reported. Summary of the characters distinguishing different Laonice species from Falkland Island and wider region can be found in Table 1 and 2.

Diagnosis. Voucher is the largest specimen; incomplete, an anterior fragment 37mm long, 4mm wide for 42 chaetigers. Anterior part of body enlarged and flattened; colour in alcohol off white to yellow.
Prostomium narrow, anteriorly rounded; indistinctly fused with peristomium by a thin membrane (peristomial lateral wings not rising above prostomium); eyes absent or present as only one pair of small red eyes; occipital antenna present, rudimentary, cirriform; caruncle long, continuing posteriorly to chaetiger 15. Palps not observed.
Branchiae from chaetiger 2; small, cirriform at first increasing in length and thickness in subsequent segments; fused to notopodial postchaetal lamella basally; exact number of branchiae impossible to define, since all the specimens are incomplete.
Chaetiger 1 slightly shorter than chaetiger 2, with triangular, short notopodial postchaetal lamellae and rounded neuropodial lamellae; postchaetal lamellae of following chaetigers increasingly larger, triangular and acutely pointed in notopodia, rounded in neuropodia.
Dorsal crests not observed. Neuropodial pouches present; first occurrence varies from segment 6-10, most commonly appearing from segment 7; initially these may be small and translucent (can be easily overlooked) developing into obvious fleshy pouches by segment 10.
Capillaries narrowly limbate, with fine granules imbedded in shaft arranged in two rows in both notopodia and neuropodia throughout. Sabre chaetae, granulated throughout most of its length, present form chaetiger 15, 1-3 per fascicle. Neuropodial hooded hooks present from chaetigers 27 - 31; 8 -10 per fascicle; hooks bidentate (in lateral view) with main fang surmounted by a smaller apical tooth; shaft stout and finely striated.
Pygidium missing in all specimens studied.
Remarks. This species was very abundant in samples from FI, but its superficial similarity to widespread Southern Ocean species Laonice weddellia in the shape of prostomium and start of genital pouches which might have led to misidentification of this species previously. In fact the presence of Laonice weddellia has not been confirmed in the FI material so far, but it has been recorded by previous faunistic studies (Blake, 1983). As recent taxonomic description (e.g. Lopez 2011 for Laonice vieitezi) shown, the existence of new species could have been easily overlooked in the past. The most important characters which set Laonice sp. 1 apart from Laonice weddellia are: chaetae arranged in two rows only in both rami (it is 4-5 in L. weddellia), and the later start of neuropodial hooks in segments 27-31 (it is 16-25 in L. weddellia), see comparative Tables 1. and 2. for details. Many small specimens, which agreed with Laonice sp. 1 were also recorded and are considered to be juveniles.

Diagnosis. Voucher is the only specimen collected in this study. Incomplete, small and slender specimen 4mm long and 0.2mm wide for 23 chaetigers (of these last 6 are enlarged, swollen, without obvious segmentation, likely regenerating).
Prostomium anteriorly rounded, posteriorly extending to the end of chaetiger 1 as an elongated, slender caruncle; eyes absent. Peristomium partially fused to chaetiger 1, not pronounced into lateral wings. Branchiae missing in all chaetigers, but at chaetiger 2 a small, digitiform branchia was observed (on one side only). Notopodial and neuropodial lamellae are prominent, both narrow, elongated, protruding away from the body (rather than lying flat on the body), similar size in chaetigers 2-16, smaller in chaetiger 1, absent from chaetiger 17 until end of fragment (the swollen, regenerating region). All chaetae capillaries; sabre chaetae and hooded hooks absent in 23 chaetigers long fragment. Dorsal crests absent. Pygidium unknown.
Remarks. The presence of small branchial stumps (initially observed at least on chaetigers 2 and 3, but now lost due to damage during the examination), the shape of prostomium suggest this species may belong to genus Prionospio Malmgren, 1867. However absence of neuropodial hooks in 23 chaetigers is unusual in this genus (hooded hook normally start in chaetigers 10-20, see Paterson et al., 2015). The distribution and form of branchiae, an important diagnostic feature is also unknown in this specimen. While this species can be distinguished from the other spionid material from Falkland Islands by combination of shape of prostomium, podial lamellae and absence of any modified chaetae, its identity cannot be established based on currently available material.

Diagnosis. Vouchers incomplete; small, slender bodied worm, vouchers  4.5 and 6.2 mm long for 22 and 51 segments, maximum width 0.4 mm; colour in alcohol pale yellow. Prostomium anteriorly rounded, slightly longer than wide, with short caruncle extending to the beginning of chaetiger 2; eyes absent; palps missing.
Branchiae present on chaetiger 3 only, absent on all other chaetigers; branchiae smooth, digiform, smaller than notopodial lamellae, often shielded and difficult to observe. Notopodial lamellae of chaetigers 23 enlarged, leafshaped and dorsally pointed, largest on chaetiger 3. Notopodial lamellae highly reduced on chaetiger 1, small and rounded on chaetiger 4, with low dorsal crests from chaetiger 9. Neuropodial lamellae of chaetiger 1 reduced to a small lobe, rounded on chaetiger 2, rounded and dorsally projecting on chaetiger 3, thereafter small and rounded.
Anterior chaetae long capillaries; granulated, stout, single sabre chaeta from chaetiger 10 in neuropodia; multidentate hooded hooks from chaetiger 11 in neuropodia, up to 5 per fascicle.  Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. The specimens collected from Falkland Islands agree well with the description of A. foodbancsia, which has been described from the shelf of Bellingshausen Sea (Mincks et al., 2009). Due to lack of complete specimens in Falkland Island material, it is impossible to compare the occurrence and form of notopodial hooded hooks and form of pygidium with A. foodbancsia.

Diagnosis. Two incomplete vouchers are the only examples of this species collected; both anterior fragments with 14 and 16 chaetigers, 3.5mm long and 0.6mm wide.
Prostomium broad, entire, anteriorly truncated, posterior margin of prostomium not discernable as completely fused with dorsum; occipital antenna absent; eyes not observed. Peristomium separated from prostomium, not well developed.
Branchiae present, but easily lost (completely missing in one specimen), small scars at the bases of notopodial lamellae of chaetiger 2 suggest branchiae start form chaetiger 2, but missing; initially branchiae smaller than corresponding notopodial lamellae, becoming longer (twice the length of the corresponding lamellae in chaetiger 10), cirriform; presence of branchiae (scars not observed) not confirmed past chaetiger 10.  Both notopodial and neuropodial postchaetal lobes are small, short and tapering, except for notopodial lamellae on chaetiger two these are at least twice the size of those on other segments and more pigmented. Notochaetae present only in 16 chaetigers long fragments. Modified chaetae, dorsal crest, genital pouches and pygidium not observed.

Supplementary diagnosis. Additional specimen has been examined from another collection around Falkland Islands as part of taxonomic standardization exercise. This specimen was a longer anterior fragment of 27 chaetigers and presence of bidentate hooded hooks was confirmed from chaetiger 18; two teeth are widely apart, enclosing a nearly 45 degree angle.

Remarks. Although only two very short anterior fragments were available for examination the distinctive shape of prostomium allies this species with genus Aonidella. No SEM examination has been undertaken, therefore pits of 6th chaetiger cannot be confirmed (see Greaves et al. 2011 and Meißner et al. 2014).
Of the three known species in this genus, only A. insolita (Greaves, Meißner & Wilson, 2011) known from 393m depth in Shark Bay region, Indian Ocean, Australia can be easily distinguished by presence of genital pouches from segment 6. There is an extended discussion of rather subtle taxonomical differences between the other two species  A. dayi López-Jamar, 1989 and A. cirrobranchiata (Day, 1961) presented in López (2010) and Meißner et al. (2014). López (2010) reported Aonidella from the Bellinghausen Sea (first record from the Southern Ocean) and assigned this specimen to South African A. cirrobranchiata (Day, 1961) as well as providing a detailed description of these specimens. The Bellinghausen Sea specimens agree well with Falkland Island specimen, which are therefore assigned here to this species.

Neuropodia adorned with various lobes and cirri arise as follows: chaetigers 1-3 with single, triangular lobe at ventral-most edge of neuropodium, chaetiger 4 with 2 lobes on raised ridge, chaetigers 5-6 with thin membranous lamella with numerous (>30) very small papillae, chaetiger 7 with 10 large triangular lobes (5-7 in smaller specimens). Neuropodia of chaetigers 8-11 resembling those of chaetigers 5-6; subsequent (abdominal) neuropodia reduced to long, narrow lobes with few long neurochaetae.
Neurochaetae of first 7 chaetigers somewhat stout with simple, gently bent blunt tips; arranged in 4-6 (irrespective of size) palisaded rows; abdominal neurochaetae capillaries with thin slender tips, about 8 per fascicle with ventralmost group short and dorsalmost group very long. Pygidium (based on additional small, but complete specimen) a simple wide ring, with one median and 2 lateral cirri.
Methyl Green stain patern: Stain retained in prostomium and peristomium, with the anterior part of peristomium staining strongest, chaetiger 1-4 do not retain stain, chaetigers 5-10 stain lightly inter-ramally, from chaetiger 12 until end of the fragment with stain concentrating on the posterior edge of the neuropodial lamellae; no patterns of dorsum or ventrum detected.
Remarks. This species belongs to a group in which notopodia are missing on chaetigers 7-10 and neuropodium on chaetiger 4 is multilobed with 2- 3 lobes in this case. FI species is clearly different from two Apistobranchus species known from the area. A. glacierae Hartman, 1978 has notopodia on all segments, while in A. gudrunae Hartmann-Schröder and Rosenfeldt, 1988 reported notopodia missing on segment 8 only.
However it is difficult to distinguish FI specimens from A. ornatus Hartman, 1965 redescribed by Blake (1996) from the Pacific, which in turn is difficult to distinguish from A. typicus (NW Atlantic distribution) other than by methyl green stain (see discussion in Blake, 1996).  Falkland Island specimen do not stain uniformly as Blake (1996) reported for A. ornatus and no paired ventral line extending from chaetiger 7-8 has been detected in FI specimens. Additionally, when comparing specimen of similar size, some subtle differences between FI specimens and A. ornatus can be detected and these are summarized in Table 1.  Overall the FI specimens are smaller than A. ornatus, with fewer rows of neurochaetae and fewer lobes on chaetigers 4. We suggest that there is evidence that FI specimens represent new species, which requires formal description.

Amage sculpta Ehlers, 1908
Voucher. Sea Lion: station 22MFA
Diagnosis.  Voucher specimen complete, body robust and compact, narrowing posteriorly, 13.5mm long and 3.2mm wide (at the widest part of thorax). Thorax composed of 14 thoracic chaetigers, with 11 thoracic uncinigers; abdomen with 10 uncinigers. Paleae absent. Four pairs of  branchiae arranged in segmental fashion (in diagonal vertical line), well separated by a large median gap; branchial styles mostly missing, one still attached in voucher, smooth and cylindrical. Abdominal uncinigers with rudimentary notopodia.
Remarks.  Falkland Island specimens agree well with Amage sculpta  described from Southern Ocean by Ehlers (1908).  Another Amage species with 10 abdominal uncinigers is Amage scutata from deep-Pacific, which however possesses 17 thoracic segments unlike FI specimens and A. sculpta, which have 14. Amage benhami recently described form Southern Ocean differs in having 15 thoracic chaetigers, of which 12 are uncinigers and 15 abdominal uncinigers among the other characters (see Reuscher et al. 2009 for details).
Distribution. Southern Ocean, Falkland Islands.

Phylo felix heterosetosa Hartmann-Schröder, 1965
Voucher specimen. Loligo: Station L2FA, Vinson West: Station 3BMFA, Inflex: Station 3MFA.
Diagnosis. A large, robust species; vouchers incomplete, 2 large and 1 smaller specimens, 6-15mm long and 2-2.8mm wide for 35, 39 and 24 segments; thorax anteriorly wide, dorsoventrally flattened, narrowing posteriorly; abdomen cylindrical. Colour in alcohol dark yellow with brown inter-segmental patches mid-dorsally starting in between chaetigers 7-8 to 25-26; body segments narrow, crowded in abdomen.                                                                                                                                     Prostomium short, conical, sharp. Branchiae from chaetiger 5 in smaller specimens or 6 in larger ones , continuing to the end of the fragments; strap-like, triangular, progressively increasing in size.
	Thorax divided into anterior (chaetigers 1-11 in larger specimens and 1-10 in smaller ones) and posterior regions (chaetigers 12-16 and 11-15 respectively), categorised by spines in neuropodia, with ventral papillae. Notopodia of anterior thoracic region with elongated, slightly basally swollen bulbous postchaetal lobes and dense crenulated capillaries (long and short). Neuropodia of anterior thoracic region low lobes with a single row of large (up to 8), triangular podial papillae, with a single row of crenulated capillaries and 6 rows of modified spines; spines thick, short, distally bent, with transverse ridges, yellow to brown in colour. Notopodia of posterior thoracic region similar to preceding chaetigers; neuropodia of posterior thoracic region with 5 robust, dark yellow to light brown, protruding spines with enlarged, blunt, distal tip (not forming pronounced spear-head shape as in P. felix), in addition also modified spines of preceding segments (located ventrally to the large spines) and single row of crenulated capillaries. Ventrum of posterior thoracic region with ventral papillae (in addition to similar podial papillae in neuropodia), increasing in number from 1 (in ch. 12) to 6 to ~10.
	Abdomen from chaetiger 16 or 17; with ventral papillae on chaetigers 17-21 (16-17 in small specimens), reducing in number from ~ 10 to 4 then 1 by chaetiger 21. Abdominal notopodia with lobe (similar to those in thorax), notopodia connected by low dorsal crests; long, slender, inter-ramal cirrus present. Neuropodia with barrel-shaped, distally notched lobes; small triangular ventral cirrus present. Notochaetae long, thin, serrated capillaries and furcate chaetae. Neurochaetae very few long capillaries (often broken off). Ventral papillae absent. Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. This species can be distinguished from Phylo felix in having 4 segments in posterior thoracic region (not 8-9), smaller number of neuropodial papillae in thorax with ~ 6 (not ~15), the presence of ventral papillae in up to 6 anteriormost abdominal chaetigers (as opposed to absent in abdomen). The smaller FI specimen is very similar to Phylo felix heterosetosa described by Hartmann-Schröder (1965) from Chile. In larger vouchers some variation occurs in that branchiae are present from chaetiger 6 (not 5). Also there are 11 segments in anterior thoracic region (not 10), the spines are clearly protruding well beyond the body wall in FI specimens and ventral papillae cover larger number of chaetigers.
Distribution. Chile, Falkland Islands in slope depths (~1000m).

Voucher specimens. Sea Lion: Station 65MFC (adult), Station 51MFA (adult), Station 29MFA (juvenile), Station 37MFC (juvenile).
Diagnosis (Adult). A large, robust species; vouchers incomplete 29 - 45mm long and 2.7 - 3mm wide for 50 and 58 segments; thorax anteriorly wide, dorsoventrally flattened, narrowing posteriorly; abdomen cylindrical. Colour in alcohol dark yellow. Prostomium short, conical, sharp. Branchiae from chaetiger 5, continuing to the end of the fragments, strap-like, triangular, progressively increasing in size. Thorax divided into anterior (chaetigers 1-10) and posterior (chaetigers 11-18(19)) areas, with spear-shaped spines in neuropodia, with ventral papillae regions. Notopodia of anterior thoracic region with large bulbous (very wide and round basally extending into slender tip) postchaetal lobes and dense crenulated capillaries (long and sort). Neuropodia of anterior thoracic region low lobes with a single row of large (up to 15), triangular podial papillae, with single row of crenulated capillaries and  3 rows of modified spines; spines thick, short, distally bent, with transverse ridges, yellow to brown in colour. Notopodia of posterior thoracic region similar to preceding chaetigers. Neuropodia of posterior thoracic region with 5-7 large, brown, protruding, spear-shaped spines (often broken off but dark broken stems can be observed). In addition to modified spines and crenulated capillaries; posterior thoracic region with ventral papillae (in addition to similar podial papillae in neuropodia), up to around 20, greatly reduced in number (around 5) in the last chaetiger of this region.
Abdomen from chaetiger 18-19; with bulbous notopodial lobe (similar to those in thorax); long, slender, lanceolate (slightly bulging in the middle) inter-ramal cirrus present; neuropodia with barrel-shaped distally notched lobes; with small triangular ventral cirrus. Notochaetae long, thin, serrated capillaries and furcate chaetae; neurochaetae very few long capillaries (often broken off). Ventral papillae absent. Pygidium not observed.

Diagnosis (Juvenile). Smaller than adults; vouchers incomplete 3 - 5.5mm long and 0.7 - 0.8mm wide for 25 and 30  segments; body shape as in adults; branchiae start from chaetiger 5 as in adults. Thorax (overall) shorter than in adults; anterior region with 1-10 chaetigers (as in adults), posterior region much shorter than in adults with 2-4 chaetigers, bearing protruding spear-shaped spines (often broken off); spear-shaped spines less robust than in adults, often colourless or with yellow to light brown hues, 2-3 per ramus, Ventral papillae present in posterior thoracic region (but in the smallest specimens these are not developed). Abdomen as in adults. All other chaetae as in adults.
Remarks. The juvenile specimens can be easily misidentified as Orbinia (if the ventral papillae are clearly present) or as Scoloplos (if the ventral papillae are very few or overlooked), because the spear-shaped spines (hallmark of genus Phylo) are so often broken off. While in adults the spear-shaped spines are also often broken off, their dark, robust stems can be clearly visible. This is often not the case for juveniles (although this is somewhat dependent on the size of the juveniles) and careful examination under compound microscope may be necessary.
	There appears to be some variation in specimens identified as Phylo felix by previous authors subsequent to species original description by Kinberg (1866) (see Ehlers 1900, 1901, Monro 1930, Hartman 1966). Phylo felix heterosetosa has been described by Hartmann-Schröder (1965) from Chile as a result of this variation (e.g. spines not protruding from body wall), but it is possible that other as yet unrecognised species may be present. For example, Hartman (1966) reported spear-shaped spines protruding in chaetigers 11-19 (consistent with FI specimens) in Phylo felix, but ventral papillae were present in chaetigers 11(12) 20 (21), while in FI specimens (adults) the ventral papillae are found in chaetigers 14-18 (19). However it is not possible to establish this without re-examination of specimens from different locations and revision should be carried out.

Voucher specimen. Sea Lion: Station 29MFC
Diagnosis.  Long and very slender species; voucher specimens incomplete with 51 segments, 8mm long, 0.3mm wide; body cylindrical, thin, of uniform width; colour white to pale yellow in alcohol.
	Prostomium conical, longer than wide, anteriorly rounded, with small terminal papilla; eyes absent; no pigmentation observed; nuchal organs slightly curved slits in middle part of prostomium.
	Branchiae from chaetiger 7, 4 pairs in voucher (but varies from 3 to 5 pairs), all short, particularly first and last pair very short (easily overlooked) about twice as long as wide, middle pairs of branchiae longer, about four times as long as wide, all of similar form with blunt tips.
	Notopodial postchaetal lobes very small, knob-like in prebranchial segments, becoming larger digiform in branchial segments (but still very small about 1/3 of the length of corresponding branchiae), getting thin in postbranchial region. Neuropodial postchaetal lobes not observed.
	Notochaetae always capillaries, longest and dense in anterior part of the body, arranged in single row, not particularly numerous about 10 per fascicle, even fewer in posterior segments. Neurochaetae capillaries similar in form and number to notochaetae, but longer. Modified neurochaetae appear first in chaetiger 17 in voucher specimen as a single, stout, strongly curved (sickle-shaped), straw-coloured to brown spine with unidentate tip and well develop hood on the convex side, these increase to 3 in number in subsequent chaetigers accompanied by two short capillaries, eventually increasing to 5 per fascicle in posterior segments. Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. FI specimens agree well with L. antarctica as described by Strelzov, 1973, although the number of branchiae is more variable 3-5 rather than 3 as reported by Strelzov. This observation agrees with other specimens of this species from Magellan regions as reported by Montiel et al. (2002). Few aberrant specimens agreeing well with L. antarctica, but lacking all branchiae were encountered. Currently, it is assumed that these are damaged specimens in which the branchiae were lost.
Distribution. Southern Ocean (Kemp coast type locality), Weddell Sea, King George Island, Chile (Beagle Channel and Continental slope off Tierra del Fuego) at 100 1162m, Falkland Islands.

Voucher Specimen. Inflex: Station 5MFA
Diagnosis.  A small to moderate-sized, long species; voucher specimen incomplete with 112 segments, 18 mm long and 0.3 mm wide; body narrow, slightly expanded in prebranchial region somewhat dorsally flattened in branchial region, cylindrical posteriorly.
	Prostomium conical, longer than wide; eyes absent; nuchal organs consisting of 2 short longitudinal slits in the middle of prostomium.
	Branchiae from chaetiger 8, 14 pairs (in voucher), first branchial pair rather short with blunt tips, but later pairs getting long tapering distally into acute tips .
	Notopodial postsetal lobes short in prebranchial segments, getting longer and cirriform with slightly inflated base in branchial region, becoming very thin in postbranchial regions. Neuropodial postchaetal lobes not observed.
	Capillary chaetae of noto- and neurochaetae of prebranchial and branchial regions longest and most dense; postbranchial capillaries thinner and shorter. Modified neurochaetae appear from about chaetiger 25 (in voucher specimen) as a single unidentate spine with well-developed hood on convex side, increasing in number up to 6 per fascicle in posterior segments; size, shape and degree of curvature of spines highly variable within fascicle, usually 2 short heavily curved spines and 4 longer, gently curved spines present; modified neurochaetae accompanied by 2 slender capillaries. Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. Levinsenia acutibranchiata was described by Strelzov (1973) and distinguished from cosmopolitan Levinsenia gracilis by branchiae tapering into acute tips in L. acutibranchiata but blunt in L. gracilis. This feature has also been found in FI specimens. Strelzov (1973) also pointed to differences in notopodial lobes and shape of spines, but the second character appears to be rather variable in L. gracilis to be of value as evident from the images in Strelzov (1973). Additionally subspecies L. gracilis minuta with branchiae with acute tips was described by Hartmann-Schöder (1965) from Chile. Strelzov in his revision (1973) considered her specimens to belong to L. gracilis, he did not comment on the character of branchiae with acute tips and the similarity to L. acutibranchiata. Without access to Chilean specimens of Hartmann-Schröder and Uruguayan specimens of Strelzov, it is difficult to say if these two species are conspecific. We have opted to identify the FI material as Strelzovs species until this issue is resloved.
Distribution. Uruguay shelf at 90 -175m, Falkland Islands.

Voucher specimen. Sea Lion: Station 38MFB, Station 44MFA
Diagnosis.  Vouchers are complete specimens 12-14 mm long, 0.8-0.9mm wide, for about 106-110 segments. Colour in alcohol opaque, white to light tan, sometimes dots of brown-reddish pigment on body segments. Body robust, thick, dorso-laterally flattened anteriorly, with numerous crowded segments, narrowing posteriorly.
	Prostomium short wider than long, partially fused to peristomium. Antenna very short, clavate, arising from the posterior part of prostomium, reaching anterior margin of first chaetiger; eyes absent; pair of nuchal organs originating from posterior margin of prostomium, extending anteriorly as oblique slits nuchal slits, sometimes with dark pigment. Lateral lips of mouth formed by peristomium; posterior lip formed by chaetigers 1-2.
	Branchiae from chaetiger 4, 16 pairs in voucher specimen, but can be variable; all branchiae except last few similar in size, very short (extending half way to dorsal midline), last few about half that length; each narrow, often narrowing to short, blunt terminal papilla.
	Notopodial postchaetal lobes of chaetigers 1-3 shorter than following; those of branchial region longer, digitate somewhat inflated at the base, each about one-half as long as branchiae; lobes in postbanchiale segments becoming slender and long.
	Capillary setae present in all parapodia becoming much longer in postbranchial segments; modified neurosetae from chaetigers 27 and 28 in two voucher specimens (this varies with size), each thick (stem somewhat bulging in the middle), can appear striated with yellow hues, distally curved, lacking arista, at first only one spine present, then increasing in number with up to 8 in posterior segments; accompanied by very fine capillaries. Pygidium collar-like segment with 1 short terminal cirrus and 2 long thin lateral ones.
Remarks. Aricidea simplex is very distinctive, and easily recognized by its thick, robust body, short head with the rounded prostomium, short antenna, and robust curved neuropodial spines. In specimens stained with Rose Bengal there are often distinct red stripes in the ventral anterior chaetigers. Preserved specimens are also often dorsally arched.
	There appears to be some discrepancy when it comes to length of branchiae between South African and Pacific specimens. Day (1963, 1967) described anterior branchiae as overlapping at midline, however Blake (1996) noted that all branchiae are short (reaching half way to midline). Further there appear to be some differences in structure of spines, with Pacific specimens having shorter, stubbier and more strongly curved spines than those pictured by Day (1967). Specimens collected from FI agree well with Blake (1996) description in possessing short branchiae and robust, well curved spines. It is possible that they are actually different species but this requires examination of material from a range of localities which is beyond the scope of the present study.
Distribution. Apparently widespread but see Remarks above, found in outer shelf to lower continental slope depths 100¬3000+ m: South Africa; Uruguayan shelf; Patagonian shelf; Scotia Sea; Southern Ocean; New Zealand slope; Bering Sea; Japan; Caroline Islands; California, Falkland Islands.

Long digiform branchiae (17 pairs in FI voucher specimen), length and form of notopodial lobes. Importantly absence of any modified neurochaetae (in 63 segments), all neurochaetae are capillaries only.

Voucher specimen. Sea Lion: Station 54MFB
Diagnosis.  Voucher incomplete specimen with around 60 segments (body is posteriorly coiled and segments are impossible to count and exact measurement difficult to obtain), around 10mm long, 0.4 mm wide; colour in alcohol white; body dorsoventrally flattened anteriorly, cylindrical posteriorly, posterior part of the body coiled.
	Prostomium weakly pear-shaped, narrowing anteriorly, nuchal grooves oblique, directed anteriorly. Antenna short, wide base with 5 branches, each branch simple (not branched); eyes absent. Posterior lip of mouth on ventrum of chaetiger 1 and partially on chaetiger 2. Branchiae from chaetiger 4, 17 pairs in voucher specimen, anterior branchiae (1-4 pairs) very wide, just meeting at middline with their tips, pairs 5- 9 getting longer with produced tips, posterior branchiae (pairs 10-12) longest, more slender, with very pronounced elongated tips, the most posterior branchiae slender, reducing in size with the last pair only slightly longer and thicker than corresponding notopodial postchaetal lobe. 
	Notopodial postchaetal lobes of chaetigers 1-2 small, becoming larger, cirriform with slightly inflated base from chaetiger 3 through branchial region, thereafter long, thin, cirriform. Neuropodial postsetal lobes inconspicuous.
	Notochaetae capillaries, most dense with thick, curved capillary setae in branchial region; neurosetae thicker than notosetae; postbranchial notosetae thinner and straighter; neurosetae of same segments about as thick as in branchial region but shorter, becoming transformed into modified setae in the region of chaetigers 30-40 (impossible to determine exactly due to some damage and coiling of the body); modified setae straight or curved, bearing elongated terminal spine; 4 per fascicle in posterior part of the body; several thin capillaries accompany modified setae. Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. Aricidea ramosa can be readily distinguished by the presence of branched antenna. However given its cosmopolitan distribution, it is possible that more species lumped under this name are present. For example Strelzov (1973) described some branches of prostomial antenna being distally dichotomous not entire. Types of Annenkova have been lost according to Strelzov (1973). Until careful morphological examination of specimens form type locality accompanied by molecular studies is possible, we prefer to assign FI specimens to Aricidea (Allia) cf. ramosa.

Voucher. INFLEXIBLE: Station 1MFA.
Diagnosis.  Medium sized, robust species. Voucher specimen incomplete with 35 segments, 2.5mm long and 0.75mm wide. Body robust, dorsoventrally flattened with crowded segments in anterior part of the body, widest between chaetigers 4-9; colour in alcohol dark yellow.
	Prostomium much wider than long, often arched dorsally with hunchback look, large middle lobe anteriorly flattened and separated from the side lobes by notches; nuchal slits prominent on two prostomial lateral lobes. Long thin antenna extends to chaetiger 5 in voucher specimen. 
	Branchiae from chaetiger 4, 8 pairs, not meeting at midline where the body is widest (chaetigers 4-9), reducing in size posteriorly (reaching midline as the body becomes more narrow), all very broad, oval, distally narrowing into short but acute tips.
	Notopodial postchaetal lobes developed, smaller on segments 1-3 then getting longer in branchial region, branched (bi-lobed) lobes occur on segments 3- 8 (the second branch is extremely small in chaetiger 3, but clearly observed in shirla-stained specimens).  Neuropodial lobes prominent, oval flaps, largest in branchial region.
	Notochaetae always capillaries, long and dense in anterior part of the body;  modified neurochaetae begin to transition from chaetiger 21 in voucher specimen, increasing in number and in thickness (up to 7 per fascicle on the last segment), only thickened gently curved chaetae with long thin arista observed in 35 chaetigers long fragment, accompanied by several long capillaries.
	Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. Aricidea antennata and A. quadrilobata Webster and Benedict, 1887 were synonimized by Strelzov (1973), but represent distinct species according to Blake (1996) who based this conclusion on an examination of numerous specimens from both the Atlantic and Pacific sides of North America. According to Blake (1996) the Atlantic species should be called A. quadrilobata and has the broad prostomium and single notopodial postsetal lobes, while the Pacific form has the truncated prostomium and double notopodial lobes. Our specimens agree well with A. antennata in possessing double notopodial lobes in anterior segments 3-8, although Blake's specimens had these in segments 5 -14. Further, there appear to be some differences in branchial structure as Blake's Pacific specimens have posterior branchiae with long, filamentous tips, but tips in FI specimens are all short. Heavy spines reported by Blake were not observed, but it is possible that FI specimens are too shorter fragments in order to observe full variety of modified notochaetae. Until more material is available, we assign the FI specimens to Aricidea (Allia) cf. antennata Annenkova, 1934.

Prostomium is distinctly pear-shaped, with prominent oblique nuchal organs on posterior part of prostomium; eyes absent.  Unpaired prostomial antenna very long (voucher 44MFC, juvenile, incomplete 2mm long and 0.1mm wide), extending to chaetiger 6 (at its longest), antenna easily lost, in many specimens antenna missing completely or regenerating and of variable length can be extremely short knob-like or extending past segment 1 somewhat arched (voucher 12MFA) .
	Branchiae present from chaetiger 4, easily broken off, can be missing entirely, around ~20 pairs in adults (~14 pairs in juveniles), foliaceous extending into tips, anterior pairs just about meeting in the middle, branchiae becoming longer with 3 (of the last 5) pairs extremely long with bulbous base and very long thin tips, the very last one or two pairs extremely short.
	Notopodial postchaetal lobes very small in prebranchial segments, large angular (elbow-shaped) in branchial region, becoming very thin and long (thread-like) in postbranchial region. Neuropodial lobes inconspicuous.
	Notochaetae always long, dense capillaries. Neurochaetae, in addition to capillaries, distinct spines present from segment 23 in small (juvenile) specimen and 25 in adult, up to 7 per fascicle, appearing somewhat distally bidentate, occasionally with indistinct pubescence, often with short, thin arista arising from the convex side . Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. Important characters, such as antenna and branchiae easily lost in this species, several vouchers were used to show full set of characters of this species. Of the currently known species of Aricidea (Acmira) subgenus the FI specimens is most similar to Aricidea (Acmira) assimilis  Tebble, 1959 in shape of prostomium and length of antenna. Tebbles description is severely lacking in detail. Branchiae are inadequately described to compare these structures and types and paratypes re-examined at NHM London were found to be in poor condition, with most branchiae missing. Importantly the type locality of A. (A.) assimillis is Mediterranean Sea (Israel). During his work on monograph of Paraonidae, Strelzov (1973) re-examined some of Tebbles specimens and additionally described material from the Pacific and South Georgia (SG), which he assigned to A. (A.) assimillis. The FI specimen agree well with the description given by Strelzov (1973) in shape of prostomium, length of antenna, however the shape and length of branchiae  is not well described or pictured by Strelzov (1973). The SG specimens also agree with FI specimens in the form of their modified neurochaetae, although the heavy pubescence found in Strelzovs specimens has not been confirmed in FI specimens. We suggest that FI material (and likely Strelzovs SG material) represent a different species from A. (Acmira) assimilis found in Mediterranean. Additionally, great care should be taken when identifying these specimens, because branchiae and antennae can be easily lost, the specimen in various stages of damage can be found and could be misidentified (i. e. the length of antenna is considered an important taxonomic character in Aricidea, but in this material represent various re-generation stages.

Aricidea (Allia) antarctica Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1988
Voucher specimen. Sea Lion: Station 8MFA, Station 38MFC, Station 40MFC
Diagnosis.  Small sized, slender species; voucher specimens incomplete, 2-2.5mm long, 0.2mm wide, incomplete with around 29-40 chaetigers (body is posteriorly strongly coiled, difficult to determine the number of segments); colour in alcohol white.
	Prostomium weakly pear-shaped, with prominent oblique nuchal organs on posterior part of prostomium; eyes absent. Prostomial antenna very short (reaching to segment 1), appears bi-articulate with inflated base and distally extending into slender tip.
	Branchiae present from chaetiger 4, 7 pairs; broadly oval, distally extending into short acute tip, all pairs similar in length, just about meeting in the middle .
	Notopodial postchaetal lobes very small, oval in segment 1 and 2, becoming longer with wider base (flask-shaped) on segment 3, retaining this shape in branchial segments but becoming angular (elbow-shaped), becoming very thin and long (thread-like) in postbranchial region.
	Notochaetae always simple capillaries, most dense in anterior part of the body. Modified chaetae of similar thickness to capillary neurochaetae but shorter, some gently, some strongly bent, and tapering to very fine, hair-like tip, beginning past chaetiger 20 (difficult to confirm due to coiling of the specimens), 3 per fascicle appear to be present, accompanied by think capillaries. Pygidium not observed.
Remarks. This species agrees well with Aricidea (Allia) antarctica Hartmann-Schröder & Rosenfeldt, 1988 in shape of prostomium and shape and length of antenna, branchiae and modified neurochaetae.
Distribution: Bransfield Strait (type locality), Elephant Island, Chile (continental slope off Tierra del Fuego) at 1162m, Falkland Islands.
